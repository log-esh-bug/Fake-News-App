This is despite a specific order of the Supreme Court on April 12, 2019 that political parties that bene- fited from the electoral bonds scheme should con- fidentially divulge to the EC the “detailed particu- lars of the donors as against each bond”. The order covered poll bonds bought and encashed by parties from March 2018 to April 2019. “We require all the polit- ical parties who have re- ceived donations through electoral bonds to submit to the Election Commis- sion of India (EC) in sealed cover, detailed particulars of the donors as against the each bond; the amount of each such bond and the order of April 12, 2019."
"Question on duality The question why some political parties like the Dravida Munnetra Kazha- gam (DMK) revealed their donors while others could not, either on legal or prin- cipled grounds, is likely to come up for debate before a five-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Monday. The five-judge Bench is primarily seeking an expla- nation from the State Bank of India (SBI), the author- ised bank under the scheme, on why the un- ique hidden alphanumeric serial numbers of each electoral bond were not in- cluded in the first tranche of data published by the EC 15, 2024, the date on which the top court struck down the anonymous political funding scheme as unconstitutional. “The judgment [of Fe- bruary 15, 2024] required the State Bank of India to furnish to the EC all details of the electoral bonds pur- chased, and, as the case may, redeemed by political parties, including the date of purchase/redemption, name of the purchaser and the denomination of the electoral bond purchased. It has been submitted that SBI has not disclosed the alphanumeric numbers of the electoral bonds,” the five-judge Bench said, con- veying its dissatisfaction with the bank in its order on March 15."
"In-built security feature The fact that every bond has a unique number is confirmed from a March 15, 2019 affidavit filed by the Ministry of Finance in the Supreme Court, which said that “unique hidden alphanumeric serial num- bers was an in-built securi- ty feature”.

"FAITH ▼ AGection, cause for disaster Dhritarashtra was silent when Duryodhana unleashed his fury against the Pandavas. It was not that Dhritarashtra lacked affection for his brother Pandu’s sons. The problem with Dhritarashtra was his love towards his son Duryodhana, said Kidambi Narayanan in a dis- course. Because of his excessive attachment to his son, he did not check him, or overrule his wrong decisions. But when the Pandavas depart for the forest, Dhritarashtra is anxious. He sends for Vidura and enquires about the Pandavas. Vidura tells him about the attitude of the Pandavas, which is a clear indication that they are going to have their revenge later. Vidura also says that there have been many ill omens, which show what awaits the Kauravas. Even as Vidura and Dhritarashtra are conversing, Nara- da comes to the court, and says to Dhritarashtra, “Four- teen years from now, Bhima and Arjuna will destroy your entire family. And this is entirely due to Duryodhana.” And indeed, it is Duryodhana who has put the entire Kuru clan in danger. But Dhritarashtra was more interested in keeping his son happy. In any case, this did not benefit Duryodhana either. It just led to the entire Kaurava family being wiped out even- tually.

"o most people, leaves are green and oranges are orange. But if our pets could speak, they’d disagree. We know there are many different ways to ‘see’ the world because that’s the diversity we have found in animals. Organisms with the ability to see have two or more eyes that capture light reRected by different surfaces in their surroundings and turn it into visual cues. But while all eyes have this common purpose, the specialised cells that respond to the light, called photoreceptors, are unique to each animal. For instance, human eyes can only detect wavelengths of light between 380 and 700 nanometres (nm); this is the visible range. Honey bees and many birds on the other hand can also ‘see’ ultraviolet light (10-400 nm). While the human visual range is relatively limited, it hasn’t abated humans’ curiosity about how animals see the world. Thankfully we don’t have to imagine too much. Researchers at the University of Sussex and the George Mason University (GMU) in the U.S. have put together a new camera with the ability to view the world like animals do. In a paper published in PLoS Biology, the team has written their device can even reveal what colours different animals see in motion, which hasn’t been possible so far."
"Making the invisible visible Animals use colours to intimidate their predators, entice mates or conceal themselves. Detecting variations in colours is thus essential to an animal’s survival. Animals have evolved to develop highly sensitive photoreceptors that can detect light of ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths; many even notice polarised light as part of their Umwelt – the biological systems that make a specific system of meaning-making and communication possible. Neither human eyes nor most This illustration compares three flowers - summer snowflake (A, B), blue phlox (C, D), and a blue violet (D, E) - in honeybee false colour (left) and human-visible colours (right).

Both scenarios require the subject to be motionless. The new system can visualise free-living organisms in their natural settings, however."
"The next big thing in animal vision Equipped with the new camera, the research team checked what the Rower black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta) looks like to honey bees (Apis mellifera). “To our eye, the black-eyed Susan appears entirely yellow because in the human-visible range, it reRects primarily long wavelength light,” the team wrote in its paper. “Whereas in the bee false colour image, the distal petals appear magenta because they also reRect ultraviolet, stimulating both the ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors … and those sensitive to green light … By contrast, the central portion of the petals does not reRect ultraviolet and therefore appears red.” THE GIST ▼ Human eyes can only detect wavelengths of light between 380 and 700 nanometres; this is the visible range. Honey bees and many birds on the other hand can also ‘see’ ultraviolet light ▼ Researchers created a tool that combined existing multispectral photography techniques with a new camera setup and a beam-splitter. The system records videos simultaneously in visible and ultraviolet channels in natural lighting ▼ The camera system translated what animals see in visible and non-visible light into colours compatible with the human eye"
"commercial cameras have been able to tap into this unchartered territory of animal vision. In the new study, exponents of biology, computer vision, and programming came together to create a tool that could record and track the complexity of animal visual signalling. The tool combined existing multispectral photography techniques with a new camera setup and a beam-splitter (to separate ultraviolet and visible light), all encased in a custom 3D-printed unit. The system recorded videos simultaneously in visible and ultraviolet channels in natural lighting. They fed the camera output through some code (written in Python) that could convert the visual data to the physical about how an animal’s photoreceptors work, and produced videos true to what that animal might see. These used false colours in these videos so that, for example, a particular colour could stand in to show ultraviolet imagery. In sum, the camera system translated what animals see in visible and non-visible light into colours compatible with the human eye. The time challenge The specialised cells that respond to light, called photoreceptors, are unique to each animal"
"But false colours can only stand in for so much. According to the researchers, existing techniques to visualise the colours animals see require object-reRected light to predict how an animal’s photoreceptor would respond or require a series of photographs in The camera system could allow filmmakers and ecologists to record the animal world through a new lens and create new visual experiences. He also said the platform’s striking images could be used to communicate the science of the living world to young audiences. “We are thinking of creating a science exhibit for children using our setup, Rowers, and live animals,” Dr. Hanley said. “Where children can just click a button to experience what a snake might see or a honeybee might see.” (Sanjukta Mondal is a chemist-turned-science-writer with experience in writing popular science articles and scripts for STEM YouTube channels.)

"X IceCube consists of thousands of sensors buried more than 1.4 km beneath the ice plus multiple detectors above the surface. Neutrinos are light particles that very rarely interact with matter. This is why they’re called “ghost particles”. By some estimates, a human-sized neutrino detector will have to wait for a century for a single neutrino to interact with a sensor. The larger the detector’s collecting area, the higher the chances of spotting neutrinos. IceCube is the world’s biggest ‘neutrino telescope’; its sensors are distributed throughout a cubic kilometre of ice. 8	Editorial Monday, March 18, 2024 Chennai Many elections, AI’s dark dimension"
"On the ballot The Election Commission must ensure a free and fair democratic process he rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models suggests that we are at an inRection point in the history of human progress. The speed with which the development of newer skills is taking place suggests that the day is not far off when Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) will transform into Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which can mimic the capabilities of human beings. Such a situation could revolutionise our ideas about what to expect from machines. Breakthroughs in the AI domain will bring about a new chapter in human existence, including the way people react to both facts and falsehoods."
"AI and the electoral landscape With the seven-phase general election in India having been announced, and to be held from April 19 to June 1, 2024, political parties and the electorate cannot, however, afford to ignore the AI dimension. This year, elections are also scheduled to be held (according to some reports) in as many as 50 other countries across the globe, apart from, and including, India, Mexico, the United Kingdom (by law, the last possible date for a general election is January 28, 2025) and the United States. These elections are set to alter the fate of millions of people, and policymakers and the electorate need to ponder over the positive and negative impacts of this new technology. Rapid technological breakthroughs in AI (especially its latest manifestation, such as Generative AI, that provides dynamic simulations and mimics real world interactions) carry their own burdens. It may be too early to fully contemplate the possible impact of AGI— AI systems that simulate the capability of human beings — but all this is indicative of yet another dimension to electoral dynamics that cannot be ignored. It may, hence, not be wrong to consider the elections of 2024 as a curtain-raiser to whether AI and its offerings (such as Generative AI) would prove to be a game changer. The world is by now aware that AI models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot are being employed in many fields, but 2024 would be a test case as to whether AI’s newer models could alter electoral behaviours and verdicts as well. The good news, perhaps, is that those wishing to employ Generative AI to try and transform the electoral landscape do not M.K. Narayanan a former Governor of West Bengal, and a former Executive Chairman of CyQureX Private Limited, a U.K.-U.S. cyber security joint venture With a series of elections to be held across the world in 2024, the potential of AI to disrupt democracies cannot be dismissed"
"Tacking AI ‘determinism’ AI technology makes it easier to enhance falsehoods and enlarge mistaken beliefs. Disinformation is hardly a new methodology or technology, and has been employed in successive elections previously. What is new is that sophisticated AI tools will be able to confuse the electorate to an extent not previously known or even envisaged. The use of AI models to produce reams of wrong information, apart from disinformation, accompanied by the creation of near realistic images of something that does not exist, will be a whole new experience. What can be said with some degree of certainty is that in 2024, the quality and quantity of disinformation is all set to overwhelm the electorate. What is more worrying is that the vast majority of such information would be incorrect. Hyper realistic Deep Fakes employed to sway voters, and micro targeting are set to scale new heights. The potential of AI to disrupt democracies is, thus, very considerable. Simply being aware of the disruptive nature of AI and AI fakes is not enough. It may be necessary, for democracies in particular, to prevent such tactics from distorting the ‘thought behaviour’ of the electorate. AI deployed tactics will tend to make voters more mistrustful, and it is important to introduce checks and balances that would obviate efforts at AI ‘determinism’. Notwithstanding all this, and while being mindful of the potential of AGI, panic is not warranted. There are many checks and balances available that could be employed to negate some of AI’s more dangerous attributes. The wide publicity given to a spate of recent inaccuracies associated with Google is a timely reminder that AI and AGI cannot be trusted in each and every circumstance. There has been public wrath worldwide over Google AI models, including in India, for their portrayal of persons and personalities in a malefic manner, mistakenly or otherwise. These reRect well the dangers of ‘runaway’ AI. Inconsistencies and undependability still stalk many AI models and pose inherent dangers to society. As its potential and usage increases in geometric proportion, threat levels are bound to go up. As of now, even as the potential of AI remains very considerable, it tends to be undependable. More so, its ‘mischief potential’ cannot be ignored. As nations increasingly depend on AI solutions for their problems, it is again important to recognise what many AI experts label as AI’s ‘hallucinations’. In simple terms, what these experts are implying is that ‘hallucinations’ make it hard to accept and endorse AI systems in many instances. What they further imply, specially in the case of AGI, is that it tends at times to make up things in order to solve new problems. These are often probabilistic in character and cannot be accepted ipso facto as accurate. The implication of all of this is that too much reliance on AI systems at this stage of development may be problematic. The stark reality, though, is that there is no backtracking from what AI or AGI promises, even if results are less dependable than one would like.

"The situation on the ground With many being targeted, a number of Myanmar journalists were forced to abandon their native places, seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, or in regions in Myanmar that were outside junta control. This exodus of journalists has been mirrored by the population at large, as vast numbers of Myanmar citizens — over two million within Myanmar and some 1.5 million refugee seekers — have been forced from their homes since the coup. Estimates suggest nearly half of Myanmar’s population, i.e., 25 million people, is living in conditions of poverty. The result is a highly destabilising situation for Myanmar and its neighbours.

Policymakers should approach Myanmar with an outlook focused not solely on Myanmar but, rather, with a comprehensive vision for the region’s stability and growth on the whole. Short-sighted policy such as accepting the outcome of any junta-rigged election in Myanmar, for example, will only serve to fuel the violence between the junta and the vast majority of the population. Far from stabilising the situation, it would only exacerbate the situation, internally and regionally. With an understanding of the debilitating nature of the Myanmar conRict, policymakers must appreciate that the only way forward for Myanmar, and the region, is a truly democratic post-junta Myanmar. This is in meeting with the strategic, security, and economic interests of all countries in the region. To this end, I would like to call on all stakeholders, ASEAN and the others, to support Burmese journalists and the people of Myanmar in their struggle for a peaceful, stable, prosperous, and democratic post-junta Myanmar.

First, with Mr. Shehbaz Sharif as the ‘selected’ Prime Minister, it will be easier for the army to control the civilian government. Unlike his elder brother, Nawaz Sharif, Mr. Third, a fractured electoral mandate with no clear majority for any political party has given enough manoeuvring space to the army to put PML-N and PPP in a politically weak coalition. various parties. This political wrangling will help divert attention from the wrongdoings of the military establishment and put the spotlight on the political class and civilian institutions. Finally, with a ‘selected’ and weak prime minister in office, General Munir may now plan to seek an extension in November 2025. It is noteworthy that these were the first National Assembly polls under his tenure as the COAS. His responsibility was to ensure a free and fair election in a politically polarised Pakistan — a task at which he failed miserably. Any rapprochement between Mr. Khan and the military establishment looks unlikely. Hinting at Mr. Khan’s style of politics, General Munir said that Pakistan needed “stable hands and a healing touch to move on from the politics of anarchy and polarisation, which does not suit a progressive country of 250 million people.” Ironically, the army’s interference in the elections has dashed all hopes of providing a “healing touch” to the people."
"A loss for the people After a favourable election outcome, the military establishment now feels more emboldened to tighten its grip on Pakistan’s civilian and political institutions. Journalists, PTI supporters, human rights activists, and minority communities are increasingly being targeted by state security agencies. Regular internet shutdowns, excessive social media monitoring, and the banning of platforms such as X have become daily occurrences. In his second year as COAS, with a new coalition government in power, General Munir will assert more control over all spheres of governance. As the military establishment wins another political battle by disregarding the public mandate, the ultimate loss will be borne by the people.

What are Integrated Assessment Models? Do these models follow the principle of equity? What did the latest study find with respect to over 500 future emissions scenarios?"
"Rishika Pardikar The story so far: n a study published on March 4, researchers analysed more than 500 future emissions scenarios the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed in its latest reports. These scenarios relate to mitigation actions like reducing carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels and increasing carbon sequestration through forestry. It found that across all 556 scenarios, income, energy-use, and emissions disparities between developed and developing countries are projected to continue up to 2050."
"Why does equity matter? These principles recognise that while tackling climate change requires global action, richer countries are better placed to shoulder bigger climate action responsibilities than poorer ones. By viewing climate action solely through the lens of global-level technical and THE GIST ▼ In a study published on March 4, researchers analysed more than 500 future emissions scenarios the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed in its latest reports. ▼ The scenarios were found to project higher carbon sequestration from land-based carbon sinks (like forests) and higher deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in developing countries compared to developed ones. Thus, poorer countries, they concluded, would bear the burden of both mitigation action and carbon dioxide removal and CCS. ▼ In the study, the authors conclude that construction of IPCC scenarios will need to be both equitable and technical, and socio-economic knowledge on climate change. The IPCC is currently in its Seventh Assessment cycle (AR7)."
"How does it assess future scenarios? The IPCC uses ‘modelled pathways’ to estimate what it will take to limit the warming of the earth’s surface. These pathways are drawn using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that describe human and earth systems. IAMs are complex models that examine possible futures of the energy and climate system and economies. Its macroeconomic models can point to future growth levels in terms of GDP; its energy models can project future consumption; vegetation models can examine land-use changes; and earth-system models use the laws of physics to understand how climate evolves. With such integration across disciplines, IAMs are meant to provide policy-relevant guidelines on climate action. However, these models also have shortcomings. They prioritise least-cost assessments — for example, the absolute cost of setting up a solar plant or undertaking afforestation in India is lower than in the U.S. However, experts have said they could exercise the option of enabling countries to equitably share the burden of action, where the richest undertake more drastic mitigation action more immediately."
"What did the new study find? The study was conducted by Tejal Kanitkar and Akhil Mythri from the IPCC’s AR6 report and found they project that per-capita GDP across Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, West Asia and the rest of Asia, which together constitute 60% of the world’s population, will be below the global average even in 2050. They spotted similar inequities between the Global North and the Global South vis-à-vis the consumption of goods and services and both energy and fossil fuel consumption. The scenarios were also found to project higher carbon sequestration from land-based carbon sinks (like forests) and higher deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in developing countries compared to developed ones. Thus, poorer countries, they concluded, would bear the burden of both mitigation action and carbon dioxide removal and CCS. “Our analysis of the regional trends underlying the global modelled scenarios economic feasibility, mitigation pathways modelled using IAMs often run counter to equity principles, researchers say. “Equity in this sense would imply that developed regions need to accelerate towards net negative emissions and make the remaining carbon budget available to other less developed regions. However, the scenarios project precisely the opposite,” they wrote in their paper. In the study, the authors conclude that construction of IPCC scenarios will need to be both equitable and environmentally sound. “This is currently a major gap in the emissions modelling domain and we need to move towards model and scenario building techniques where questions of equity and climate justice come to the foreground,” they wrote.

"ndia is estimated to have 10.13 crore people with diabetes, and another 13.6 crore people who are pre-diabetic, according to a nationwide study published in 2023. This apart, over 35% of Indians suffer from hypertension and nearly 40% from abdominal obesity, both of which are risk factors for diabetes. India accounts for 17% of all diabetes patients in the world. Prevention and early detection are key to helping combat this non-communicable disease burden, experts say. One of the most commonly-used tests to diagnose pre-diabetes and diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) and to help manage diabetes, is the haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) test, also known as the glycated haemoglobin or glycosylated haemoglobin test."
"How does the test work? Sugar enters your bloodstream from the food you eat. The sugar, or glucose, attaches to the haemoglobin in your red blood cells. Haemoglobin is a protein that transports oxygen to all the cells of your body. Everybody has some sugar attached to their haemoglobin. Those with pre-diabetes and diabetes, however, have more. The HbA1C test measures the percentage of your red blood cells that have sugar-coated haemoglobin."
"Why is the test used to check for diabetes? A paper was published in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine in 2016 entitled ‘The role of haemoglobin A1c in the assessment of diabetes and cardiovascular risk’. It stated: “HbA1c was first discovered in 1955, but elevated HbA1c levels in diabetes patients were not noted until 1968. Another eight years passed before HbA1c was correlated with blood glucose values in hospitalised"
"THE DAILY QUIZ patients with diabetes and was proposed for monitoring glycemia.” During the first few years of clinical use, the paper said, HbA1c measures were inconsistent. But as the importance of precise HbA1c measurements became apparent through studies that revealed better patient outcomes and mortality associated with lower average HbA1c, the need to reduce error margins in measurement became apparent. Following programmes to regulate HBA1c measurements and calibrate them to reference standards, standardisation and accuracy greatly improved from 1993 to 2012, the paper noted. The American Diabetes Association approved HbA1c as a diagnostic tool in 2009. In 2011, after an expert consultation with the World Health Organization (WHO), it said HbA1c could be used as a diagnostic test for diabetes “provided … stringent quality assurance tests are in place and assays are standardised to criteria aligned to the international reference values, and there are no conditions present which preclude its accurate measurement.” What do HbA1C test results look like? The HbA1C levels are provided as either a percentage or in mmol/mol (which stands for millimoles per mole). A mole is a unit of measurement often used for chemical substances. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood glucose levels are. An Hb1A1C below 5.7% is considered normal; between 5.7% and 6.4% may indicate you are pre-diabetic; and 6.5% or higher can indicate diabetes. In mmol/mol: below 42 corresponds to below 6.0%; 42-47 mmol/mol to 6.0 to 6.4%; and 48 mmol/mol to 6.5% or over. However, the test’s results may change under certain conditions, including if a patient has kidney or liver failure, severe anaemia or a blood disorder such as thalassaemia; if they have a less common type of haemoglobin found in some populations; or are under certain medications including steroids, opiates or dapsone (a drug used to treat leprosy). They may even change if a person is in early or late pregnancy. Generally, for those whose results indicate pre-diabetes or diabetes, doctors specify a goal to achieve specific HbA1C levels. But these vary from person to person and also depend on their age, health conditions, medications being taken, and other factors. Who needs to take the test and when? According to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes (2018), all individuals older than 30 years should be screened for diabetes. Those with one or more risk factors including, among others, obesity, an increased waist circumference, a history of or being treated for hypertension, a history of heart disease, and a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome should be screened earlier. Retests should be conducted after three years in case of normal glucose tolerance. If a person is pre-diabetic, retests should be annual. Your doctor may also ask you to be tested more frequently if, for instance, you’re planning to have a baby. If you have diabetes, your doctor may ask you to take it every three to six months, to keep an eye on your blood sugar levels and to check if your treatment plan is working."
"How does the test dier from others? While fasting and post-prandial (after a meal) or post-meal blood sugar tests give you blood sugar levels within a specific time frame, the HbA1C test reRects your average blood glucose levels over the last two to three months. the person’s latest meal and when they last consumed it, the HbA1C test is independent of these variables, making it more reliable. It can be taken irrespective of when the latest meal was consumed. What are the test’s limitations? This apart, while the HbA1C test remains one of the best to assess long-term control of diabetes in people known to have diabetes, it is not uniformly accepted as a diagnostic test by all global medical bodies because of its relatively low sensitivity arising from difficulties in assay standardisation. In other words, a doctor may recommend a glucose test alongside an HbA1C test to obtain a clearer picture when diagnosing a person. The test may also have limitations particular in India. A 2013 paper published in the journal Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics noted that in some clinical situations, accurate measurements are harder to make. These include having conditions like thalassaemia, structural haemoglobin variants in the population, iron-deficiency anaemia (which is relatively high in India), and the use of certain drugs. “Because of the relatively frequent occurrence of some of these conditions in some parts of India, it is important that they are looked for when evaluating an inappropriately high or low HbA1c level. Alternative indices may have to be used for assessing glycemic control in these cases,” the paper noted."

GETTYIMAGES/ISTOCK Investment, a loser’s game? Why investing in equity funds is behaviourally optimal THINKINVESTOR It is easier to invest in equity funds with a small capital and scale up as your savings potential increases with age. You need a significant amount of capital to invest directly in stocks Venkatesh Bangaruswamy goal-based investments. If you are one of them, it is worth considering why investing in equity funds is optimal. COVERNOTE K. Nitya Kalyani"
"For years, investing to avoid tax was a limited to a few, well-known options. Life insurance policy, Employee Provident Fund or Public Provident Fund and a few more. We have a wider choice now and so much else has changed around this activity of investing to reduce taxes. The most important of them is that investing to get a tax break, under various sections of Section 80 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, is on its way out. What does this imply for your year-end Rurry? Section 80 investments can be one-time commitments or repeat investments. One-time commitments like PPF, tax saving fixed deposits or National Savings Certificate mean that you can invest as much or as little as you like in one year and not at all, or a very minimal amount, the next. A life insurance policy, on the other hand usually means repeated premium payment for several years on end with the policy validity actually depending on your paying up regularly. However, if you have one of the latter, like a life insurance policy, you will still have to keep your life policy going. And please do so! Going forward, if you are investing just to save tax, keep this in mind and opt for a one-time, pay-as-you-like instrument. Of course, repeat commitments like life insurance should be in your reckoning, but only ever buy it for its real purpose, and not to save tax.

"Failure to beat averages Ellis’s analysis reveals a so- bering reality: most invest- ment managers consistent- ly fail to beat market averages, particularly dur- ing economic downturns and volatility. This failure is not due to a lack of talent but a funda- mental misalignment of strategy within the evolved market context. The essence of Ellis’s ar- gument is that the satura- tion of talent in the invest- ment world renders the conventional approach of outperforming the market through superior stock se- lection or timing ineffec- tive and counterproduc- tive.

Lastly, Buffett and Mun- ger emphasise valuation, particularly the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio. Rath- er than chasing companies with inRated P/E ratios — a speculative bet on conti- nued market favour — they focus on identifying under- valued firms with solid fun- damentals. This approach is less about uncovering the mar- ket’s next darling and more about avoiding the pitfalls of overvaluation, aligning with Ellis’s thesis that suc- cess in investing comes from not losing.

Because generating returns is a function of both skill and luck, even the most skilful money managers can generate losses. And losses hurt emotionally and financially. Yet, the regret you will face is much less when the equity fund you invested in suffers losses than if your direct investment in stocks generate losses! This is because in the latter case, you are directly responsible for the investment. Second, regardless of your investment capital, you are likely to have fewer stocks in your investment portfolio than equity funds do. So, the likelihood that an equity fund betters your performance is higher because of the possibility that some stocks are always likely to perform poorly. What if you invest in 10 stocks and three of them perform poorly, as opposed to 5 stocks out of 30 for an equity fund? Third, an active fund can move between equity and cash more quickly than you can, despite its size. This is because a money manager is likely to take a professional approach to deciding whether to take profits. You may be emotionally driven to taking a decision. short-term gains on a continual basis.

Why do you think it’s time to pass on the mantle to a younger generation? This whole season, more than playing, you have been involved in taking care of the bowling group..."
"I want to give back to cricket because cricket has given me so much. The knowledge I have received from the greats of cricket, I would like to pass it on to the younger guys. There’s no point keeping it to myself. So that is going to be the next thing. I would love to be involved in cricket, either coaching or doing something with fast bowlers or younger guys. But it will definitely be something related to cricket. For an Indian pacer, playing 100 First Class games is a big deal. No, no, I am not thinking about the Can you tell us why the Sportstar Trophy (Mumbai age-group selection tournament) is so dear to you?"
"Before playing in the Sportstar Trophy (u-17), I was a batting all-rounder and I used to bat for my school teams and even when I was just about in the circuit. I used to bat higher up the order. Then I used to bowl with the new ball, but the game-changer was the Sportstar Trophy. I received the best bowler award in that tournament and from there on I thought that I should focus more on bowling than batting and this is where I am now. Yes. I was picked in the Mumbai under-17 team as a fast bowler and from there I picked up wickets. Then I played two years of under-10, was with the India U-19 team and from there, the real journey began playing professional cricket. What is it that gets the best out of you in the finals?"
"It means a lot because you work really hard during the season, the pre-season you do a lot of fitness, put in a lot of hard yards in the entire domestic season. There are seven to eight league games when you play the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and after those league games in Ranji Trophy, there are the knockout games. You have to win the league games to be a part of those knockouts. And once you get there, whenever I played the knockouts, I used to give it more than 100% because I used to think about the hard yards that I have put in throughout the season and the championship is what you dream of at the start of the season. Once you hold the trophy in the hand, it’s a special feeling."
"It was a big moment for me because sharing the dressing room with him, you know, just looking at him, his routines, the process that he used to follow was a different feeling. It was like sitting next to God and as a youngster I always looked up to him. I also wanted to become like him. Whoever played cricket back then wanted to be like Tendulkar. I was one of them and I was lucky enough to have spent time with him. Even after my first season, another Ranji Trophy that we won, he was a part of that final as well. So the experience that he shared with me was very much helpful for my whole career. Despite being on a roll in Mumbai’s colours, opportunities were far and few in international cricket. How did you manage that phase?"
"Never did I think about being picked or not picked for India. I used to be disappointed when I was little young, but then I took it in my stride. I took it in a positive way and took it as a challenge. Every time I took the field, I wanted to prove it, prove it to myself rather than anyone else, that I am better than others. And whenever I walk onto the field, I try to become better. Yes, I do think I should have played more international cricket that I did, but that hasn’t prevented me from giving my best for Mumbai. In the latter half, when your body wasn’t really actually supporting you as much as you would have wanted, how challenging was it to keep your place in a team like Mumbai?"
"Getting an India opportunity or not, getting injured or not getting picked is part and parcel of the game for every athlete. I always took it in my stride whenever I got injured. I always thought about how will I come back fitter than what I was; and that drove me every time I got injured. If you were to pick top three moments of your career, what would they be? The first would be the India ODI cap that I got from M.S. Dhoni. The second, my first season for Mumbai — winning the Ranji Trophy for the team. And the third would be the Ranji final (in 2009-10) against Karnataka. Any regrets? Won’t call it regret as such, but I I could have worked harder to earn the Test cap is what I would like to say. How would you like to be remembered? The one who always gave 100%, a perennial team man and a good human being — more than anything else, a good individual is what you want to be."

TUESDAY - MARCH 19 - 2024 Misconceptions in fiscal federalism surcharges is also regarded as unfair. But these partly finance grants. In 2022-23, 21 per cent of State revenue receipts were from grants and 26 per cent from tax sharing. Some of the rise was due to ASHIMA GOYAL"
"ndia has a federal structure. It is one country of many diverse States; not a union of many countries. Most notable among the institutions that keep it together are the Finance Commissions (FCs), independent constitutional bodies appointed every five years, with the mandate to achieve uniform public services through the country. The first is that States should have more freedom to tax and borrow; the second that States get less than their fair share of Central taxes; the third that richer States lose out since transfers are towards poorer States."
"RIGHTS OF STATES Tax and borrowing rights: The outcomes, however, suggest that restraints on States’ fiscal freedoms are among least severe in the Indian federal structure. In 2022 Indian subnational debt at 28 per cent of GDP was the fourth highest in the world. The OECD average is 20 per cent. Theoretical principles of federalism support giving more elastic taxes, such as on incomes, to the Centre. Otherwise there would be migration away from States with higher taxes. FCs compensate by transferring resources to the States. Moreover, research finds States’ own"
"affect their tax potential. Effort is found to reduce with transfers from the Centre while the application of FRBM increased it. Now State GST is elastic so a large rise in revenues is possible with data-based collection at the point of sale. It has increased from ₹2.6 trillion in FY18 to ₹8.4 trillion in FY24BE with double-digit growth last year. Transfer of resources from Centre: Again, the facts show Indian States’ spending share is higher than in most other federal structures. Over 2015-20, States’ average share of general government expenditure was 63.9 per cent while in other large federal countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, the US and Australia it was about 40 per cent, with the Centre spending about 60 per cent. The States’ share of 29.5 per cent with States with debt exceeding the FRBM 30 per cent also tend to be the ones with high revenue deficits and low"
"CSSs were restructured but still rose. The reason was delivery of public goods, such as health, education and environment, in the Concurrent List of the Constitution remained neglected. This hurts the poor more, since the rich can find private substitutes. This delivery requires activation of the 3rd Tier, but decentralisation of funds and functionaries to the 3rd Tier mandated by the 1990s’ 73rd and 74th Amendment remained patchy across States. Tax devolution is a right, although the formula changes slightly with successive FCs after extensive consultations. Conditionalities can be imposed only on grants and these remain important for public service delivery. CSSs and other grants to local bodies, 60 per cent of which are for water and sanitation, are substituting for lack of devolution to 3rd Tier. Although States prefer a free hand their citizens have a right to uniform public services. Building human capacity is very important in India’s current the fall in international oil prices in 2014. States raised their own oil taxes. multi-dimensional poverty. The Central Ayushman Bharat has been renamed Mukhyamantri Jan Arogya Yojana. North-South divide: States in the South and West are told they are subsidising a poorer North and East. But net resource flows have differed in the past and will change again in the future. States gain much more than just resources participating in a vibrant growing common market. We see Britain suffering the consequences of Brexit. There is also protection in a fragile nuclear neighbourhood. Since northern States are more populous, and southern States more prosperous, on equity grounds, which dominates FC transfers, the North should get more. Yet, although share in total transfers was constant, since 2013 grants per capita are higher for the South. This is the effect of rising conditional transfers since more eMcient States get more of these. For example, the four southern States have more than 50 per cent of Ayushman Bharat patients. Better medical facilities increase the use of this scheme. So they should not be complaining about conditionality."
"RESPONSIBILITIES, OUTCOMES The States with debt exceeding the FRBM 30 per cent also tend to be the ones with high revenue deficits and low capital expenditure. This is not fair to other States or to themselves. Conditionalities deliver more to better performing States and induce better performance, helping States escape low level traps and distorting choices such as in the electricity sector or water supply.

"The initial surprise unfolded in the Chitra Sharma vs Union of India case, where the Supreme Court's decision to include allottees in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) marked a departure from the written law. This empowered allottees, prompting the government to swiftly bring them under the definition of financial creditors through an ordinance. This move granted allottees a powerful tool to initiate insolvency proceedings against defaulting real estate companies, acting as a reminder for developers to uphold their commitments. The rationale behind this innovation was to safeguard the interests of allottees, ensure the survival of Real Estate Infrastructure Companies, and facilitate the completion of projects."

"segment particularly challenging. Restricting insolvency only to projects is a pathbreaking move in India’s insolvency landscape. IBC requires novel and creative manoeuvres and tying them up with procedural hurdles would be detrimental to larger interests of resolution. Experimentation is the first principle in an economic law like IBC, which has even received the Supreme Court’s aMrmation in CoC of Essar Steel India Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta & Ors., “The experiment contained in the Code, judged by the generality of its provisions and not by so-called crudities and inequities that have been pointed out by the petitioners, passes constitutional muster. To stay experimentation in things economic is a grave responsibility, and denial of the right to experiment is fraught with serious consequences to the nation.”. The solution in an innovative approach must not be buried under procedural complexity. It is a necessity for navigating a dynamic and ever-changing economic environment. Hopefully, the real estate industry’s approach could show the way to other industries. one instrument that really matter: monetary policy and interest rates. Whether on the eve of meetings of the US Fed’s monetary policy committee, or in the interregnum between meetings, economic policy discussions largely focus on whether the Fed would begin cutting rates; whether the expectations of “the markets” on the likelihood of those cuts and their magnitude will be met; and whether investors have “factored” in the likelihood that those cuts would or would not occur. It is indeed true that the effective Fed Funds Rate has risen from a low of less than a tenth of a percentage point in early February 2022 to levels above 5 per cent over the 15 months ending May 2023 and currently stand at around 5.3 per cent (Chart 1). In fact, taking a long historical view the current rate does not appear to be significantly inflated. Rather, what appear to be historically exceptional are the near zero rates that prevailed for a long period starting after the 2008 financial crisis (Chart 1). MUCH-NEEDED CORRECTION Given that, the decision to raise interest rates from the exceptional, historic lows necessitated by the worst crisis since the Great Depression should be seen as nothing more than a much-needed correction. Since the period after the pandemic saw inflation rates rise above “target” BANKS TAKE A HIT If they needed to dispose of their bond holdings when their own short-term debt fell due, they expected to be able to do so without loss because of expectations of stable (and relatively coupled with the significant levels and generated fear that inflation low) bond yields. This was the impact on common buyers and labour dynamics, make this The writer is a chartered accountant and insolvency professional would not be transient, an increase in interest rates was the likely outcome.

In practice, inflation and interest rates have tracked each other, probably because interest rate changes followed inflation, rather than the other way around (Chart 2). These are not the only reasons why the fuss over interest rates and the Fed’s actions is intriguing. One claim is that high interest rates would slow growth by dampening demand. While this is likely to be generally true of debt financed housing, investment and consumption spending, the responsiveness of corporate investment to higher interest rates is likely to be the weakest. Moreover, what happens to growth depends on a whole host of other factors, including government spending changes and the depletion of savings accumulated during the pandemic, for example."
"GROWTH SPIKE In practice, the recent period when interest rates rose has not been one of slowing growth, at least in the US, as Chart 3 illustrates.

"The campaign against higher interest rates is intriguing because, not all players in capitalism’s many markets are losers. low yielding bonds and allocate more to equity investments. That effect, however, would be counteracted by any withdrawal of speculative investors from markets following the rise in interest rates. Those investors tend to borrow cheap and buy into equity, driving up equity prices. There were fears that they may pull out as the cost of capital rises. Interestingly, even this has not happened. As Chart 4 shows, the S&P Composite Index did not reverse its long term rise and remained at record highs, even as interest rates rose. But the real twist to the story has been the developments in bond markets. Passive bond investors benefit from increases in interest rates, earning higher yields on new investments they make, while not losing capital on the bonds held to maturity. Some of them have even been forced to default in debt servicing and accept severe austerity as the price for restructuring debt by creditors. Unfortunately, their situation barely enters the discussions on macroeconomic policy in the high income countries.

"YES Securities HINDALCO (BUY) Target: ₹663 CMP: ₹530.60 We see Hindalco to be a strong Aluminium player in India in the upcoming years as well as globally.

The latest number is higher not just than the budget es- timate but also exceeds the re- vised estimate by a good margin."
"BUDGET ESTIMATE While presenting the Union Budget for FY24, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman estimated ₹43,000 crore through ‘dividends from pub- lic sector enterprises and other investments’. However, this was revised upward to ₹50,000 crore. Disinvestment proceeds   from   CPSEs   are likely to remain below the budget estimate of ₹51,000 crore, though the revised es- timate has subsumed the re- ceipts from disinvestment into ‘miscellaneous capital re- ceipts’ and set the number as ₹30,000 crore, still, that may not be achieved. Collections from dividends and disinvestment are part of non-tax revenue and main- tained by DIPAM. While the combined collection is lower than the target, it is unlikely to affect the revised fiscal deficit- target of 5.8 per cent as mobil- isation through direct tax, GST, and RBI surplus is likely to be much higher. The better dividend collec- tion can be attributed to im- proved profitability of CPSEs and a consistent dividend policy. According to Finance Ministry guidelines an- nounced  in  2016,  a  CPSE would pay an annual dividend of 30 per cent PAT (profit after tax) or 30 per cent of the gov- ernment’s equity, whichever is higher. stakes in CPSEs has not been easy for the government this fiscal.

DIPAM attributes the snail’s pace of divestment to the emphasis it lays on value creation in CPSEs. It under- lines that since the introduc- tion of the new PSE policy in January 2021, the NSE CPSE and BSE CPSE indices have surpassed benchmarks, show- casing returns of over 160 per cent and 128 per cent, respect- ively, until November 2023, and even after that, mo- mentum has been there. 10 . bl . commodities.agri.business CHENNAI businessline.

There has been much learning in the field of “regulatory theory” in India, with remarkable improvements in the general techniques of how state capacity in regulators can be achieved. Most of this knowledge has not, as yet, found its way into the reg- ulation of drug quality. A difficult feature of drugs, which strategies are required to deliver progress in the Indian context, while recognising the limitations of state capacity in India. Drug traceability systems on public blockchains can potentially help improve the authenticity of medicines throughout the supply chain. A key aspect of blockchain-based drug traceability is the assignment of a unique identifier to each drug unit. By associating each drug unit with a digital identity, stakeholders can easily track and verify its origin, authenticity, and movement across the supply chain. time around  we  switch  brands. is not present in financial regulation, special effort to find good solutions within this consti-"

At the manufacturing end, one valuable feature of the Indian environment is the presence of overseas drug quality regulators in the country, pushing up the quality of factories that seek to export. Potentially such factories can signal their quality by asserting that the production facility is, say, US Food and Drug interventions. In the journey to progress, there exists a policy pipeline where steps cannot be skipped: We run from data to research to innovative solution design to public debate to policy decisions to policy imple- mentation. This field is bedevilled by limitations in the foundations of data. The need of the hour is to establish a better measurement system to understand how the drugs industry works and the prevalence of various kinds of failings.

"he vision of Viksit Bharat sets forthachallenging agenda for India. A pivotal aspect is the imper- ative to elevate the per capita gross national income (GNI) from the current $3,348 to over $14,000, transitioning the nation from a lower-middle-income to the coveted high-income category. However, India faces the prospect of ageing before prosperity if it does not reach this goal by 2047, when 14 per cent of the population will be 65 or above. India’s annual growth must consistently surpass 10 to 12 per cent, compared to the present 6 to 7 per cent, to avoid the middle-income trap observed by Asian tigers like Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. South-Korea’s suc- cess story in raising GNI per capita from $2,130 in 1983 to $23,860 in just 25 years, attributed to developing products in domains like electronics, automobiles, and defence, offers important revelations. is public-private partnership (PPP), which has yielded great dividends in the infrastructure sector.

"Assured procurement after successful development is an important factor in the success of innovation during Covid-19 or iDEX challenges. However, it is also true that government authorities are reluctant to procure items lacking multiple bidders or precedents, both unlikely for innovative products. A clear framework for procuring indigenously-devel- oped-products, including defining an indigenously- developed-product and a mechanism for fixing a rea- sonable price, is needed. Fourth, mitigate risk in product development through government funding. The announcement of ~1 trillion with a 50-year timeline in the Interim Budget ispromising,buttheoperationaldetailswillneedmetic- ulous consideration. Successful models, including Darpa in the USA and Jozma in Israel, can provide valuable insights. India’s vibrant startup ecosystem and the success of fund of funds and iDEX models can be leveraged. Expanding the iDEX model to sectors need to be industry-led. An overarching enabling leg- islative framework needs to be created to transform the existing system. Lastly, guarding against protectionism is essential to ensure a world-class product development ecosys- tem.

Out of these 50 million, 4-5 mil- lion are expected to be direct jobs, 9-10 million may be for gig workers and the remaining 35-40 million indirect jobs, which would be created by suppliers in the value chain. Among sectors, retail and e-commerce is likely to have the highest gross merchan- dise value (GMV) of $380-400 billion by 2030, the report said. It is likely to be followed by $140-150 billion in manufacturing and $65-75 billion in the fintech sector. Moreover, agriculture, healthtech, travel and mobility, telecom and entertain- ment, and education are likely to contrib- ute a combined $260-270 billion to the Indian economy by FY30.

The number of employees Companies are likely to offer double-digit increments to junior management but ""organisations may be stricter with their bell curves, making it harder to secure top ratings,"" it said. Top performers may expect 1.8x in increments given to average-rated employees. For employees rated below average, the increment is expected to be lower at 0.4x this year than 0.6x in 2023. One out of two companies could pay at-target or above- target bonuses in 2024.

"This is not because growth is stalling. Au con- traire, growth has consistently surprised to the upside across much of the global economy last year. Encouragingly, this growth resilience has carried over into 2024, with global growth tracking close to trend this quarter. EVERYTHING,EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE Second, even assuming that inflation progressively softens towards the 4 per cent handle in the coming months, is that reason enough to start easing? To assess that, one must dig deeper into how central banks think about setting policy rates."
"vis-à-vis growth. To be sure, neutral rates are unobservable but should be thought of as the interest rate at which the economy is in equilibrium: Output gaps are closed and inflation is at target. Key to policy settings, therefore, is an assessment of where real neutral rates are in each economy. WHATABOUT INDIA? An important study in 2017 estimated that real neutral rates in India were in the 1.6-1.8 per cent range pre-pandemic. Have neutral rates gone up or down since then? It is not clear. Neutral rates: The known unknowns What does this tell us about neutral rates in India?"
"propensity to borrow and banks’ propensities to lend, falling sharply. This would argue for lower neutral rates pre-pandemic. But things have changed discernibly since then. Consequently, credit growth has been running at almost 16 per cent for the last year, almost twice as strong as nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 9 per cent - - a multiple last seen in 2007. These are not signs that monetary conditions are too tight. If anything, they may be suggesting real neutral rates in India may have risen as balance sheets have been cleaned up and the propensity to lend and borrow has increased. Furthermore, to the extent that increased digitization and infrastructure build-out in the economy push up productivity growth, it should push up neutral rates. Finally, even as the Central government remains committed to fiscal consolidation, the total public sector borrowing requirement currently is still higher today than the years before the pandemic. This would be consistent with higher neutral rates. In contrast, to the extent that the economy still remains below the pre-pandemic path – and if that suggests permanent scarring from the pandemic – that would suggest lower neutral rates. In other words, there are too manyknown unknowns about the neutral rate post- pandemic pulling in opposing directions. This uncertainty shows up in recent estimates of neutral rates in India. One studyfound that real neutral rates post-pandemic have declined to 0.8-1 per cent. But an alternative model that takes into account both business cycles and"
"financial cycles finds a neutral rate of 2 per cent. The jury is therefore still out on the evolution of neutral rates, not just in India, but also globally. Against this backdrop, for some commentators to simply assert that neutral rates are lower today – as a justification for the RBI to ease even before inflation has settled close to 4 per cent – is to not recognise the different cross-currents at play. Neutral rates apart, policyrates that operate through a Taylor Rule must also take into account the cyclical position of the economy. The fact that growth has surprised to the upside this year but core inflation has continued to soften, and is at multi-year lows, is seen as a puzzle. But this should not be a puzzle. Despite the upside growth surprise, India still remains below its pre-pandemic path – which suggests slack exists in the economy. This is consistent with the slack in the blue- collar labour market and the fact that manufacturing capacity utilization remains in the early to mid-70s. In the absence of fresh input price shocks, therefore, this slack can be expected to exert a disinflationary force on core inflation, which is what is playing out. What is the implication for policy rates? Slack (i.e., a negative output gap) would argue for actual policy rates to be temporarily below neutral. In contrast, however, projected inflation at 4.5-5 per cent one year out would still be above the 4 per cent target, which would argue for policy rates to be temporarily above neutral. This is likely what the monetary policy committee (MPC) means when it says it remains “actively disinflationary.” Implicit in this is the important recognition that India’s inflation target is 4 per cent, not a band of 4-6 per cent. In sum, the central bank will have to navigate carefully, because it confronts several moving parts: Uncertainty about neutral rates with the prospect they have increased, negative output gaps, but also forecasted inflation still above target. Against this backdrop, those who claim monetary policy must ease pre-emptively, because the potential growth is much higher and that is resulting in large output gaps, must also recognise that higher potential growth should translate into higher neutral rates. Those who claim that the RBI must focus primarily on negative output gaps must also realise the primacy accorded to inflation in the RBI’s dual mandate during normal times, and the need to focus on achieving the 4 per cent target, especially after the inflation has averaged 6 per cent"
"MONETARY POLICY AND FINANCIAL STABILITY Finally, India’s framework is that of “flexible” inflation targeting. Just as the framework creates space to respond to growth shocks from time to time, it must internalize implications for financial stability when the situation so demands. Healthybank and NBFC balance sheets havemeant that credit growth is running much abovenominal GDP growth. While this, by itself,is notaconcern foralimited amount of time,it is the quality of the credit that the RBI is correctlyvery focused on. Unsecured lending has been very strong—with credit cardlending growing at morethan 30 percent for the last year—suggestiveof excessiveexuberance acrosssome parts of the financial system. That approach will need to continue in 2024. If growth disappoints meaningfully or inflation surprises unpleasantly or financial stability concerns rise, policy will need to respond quickly and commensurately in the appropriate direction. In other words, this will have to be another year when policymakers will need to cross the river by feeling the stones.

"Putin’s ‘sweep’ is no surprise because the whole 3-day exercise was perceived to be a referendum on Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, sort of embellishes the scenario of a fixed outcome, with 87.8 per cent of the votes said to have been cast in his favour. As the former KGB officer embarks on a fifth term that will see him pass Josef Stalin and get behind only Catherine the Great as Russia’s longest ruler, an emboldened Putin could only speak of Ukraine and how Russia needs to build a buffer zone to prevent isolated attacks on Moscow during poll time that Ukraine or its proxies may have triggered. Votes were counted after soldiers accompanied ballot boxes that were taken to voters in occupied Ukraine areas like Donetsk. And yet the known outcome, despite the ‘noon’ protests, organised by those who oppose him and who may have been inspired by the late Alexei Navalny, is only part of the story of Mr Putin. What he is preparing to do in the immediate future and in his new 6-year term, which he could repeat if he defies age expectancy averages, is more relevant to the story of the contemporary world in which Mr Putin is seen as the anti-West hero in Russia, in war and in peace. What he may attempt to do to reshape geopolitics with a Russian economy seen as stronger despite the war losses and sanctions is going to be crucial even as the US dilly-dallies on weapons and other aid to Ukraine. Nothing would have changed so far as India is concerned as one of its closest friends feels more empowered to act out of the Kremlin. It might be jarring when Mr Putin takes potshots at  US  democracy  —  perhaps inspired by his love for Mr Donald Trump — but there is some basis to his words —  “no matter who wants to intimidate us, suppress us —  nobody has ever succeeded in history.” DECCAN CHRONICLE"

Flawed law The Bharatiya Janata Party is claiming the citizenship (Amendment) Act (cAA) as one of its big achievements. The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance promises to repeal it, ifvoted to power. No matter what the Modi government says in justification, the cAAis a flawed piece of legislation as it predicates citizenship on religion. It is based on the false assumption that persecution in South Asia occurs only in predominantly Muslim nations and that too only against Hindus, christians, Parsis, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists. The sum and substance of the law is that you must be a non- Muslim to be eligible for automatic citizenship. Even if Muslims are no different from non-Muslims except in the matter of faith, they are deemed ineligible to get citizenship. Asecular democracy cannot have religion as a determinant of citizenship. -G David Milton, Maruthancode Sensex crosses 7S,000 was important but it’s nothing compared to 100,000.

"ONAPRIL 1, the full-service carrier cancelled around 50 flights, which stranded passengers and sent the operations schedule into a disarray. Passengers complained about the last- minute cancellations, while the airline citedvarious reasons, including crew unavailability. The situation deteriorated the next day with the cancellation of around 52 flights. Subsequently, the Directorate General of civil Aviation (DGcA) stepped in and asked the airline to submit details on the flights that are being cancelled and delayed on a daily basis. The cancellations have affected both domestic and international flights, with many flights also experiencing delays in the domestic sector. Since then the airline has been in a damage control mode and has reduced the daily number of flights for this month.

In theshortterm, thecrisis is over, becausebycurtailingthe flights duringthecurrentmonth thedemand-supplymismatch has been sorted. However, this is nota long-term solution.

EV subsidy While subsidies can promote the sale of electricvehicles in the short run, price reduction can pose a challenge to fulfil the sudden rise in demand, impacting sales in the long run.

Hopefully, our law-makers are vocal about local cell manufacturing. -- Girish Lalwani, Delhi Vehicle cost matters Apropos of ""Recharge the EVspace"", cost is paramount for Indians. To help them shift from internal combustion engine to electricvehicles (EVs), the government must ensure that buying and running costs remain affordable. No doubt, the Centre has been pushing for cleaner fuel, but itwould do better to engage all stakeholders including manufacturers. Only when overall cost of manufacturing is low can companies offer EVs at cheaper prices.

"THE UAE, ONTuesday, and Oman before that, faced record-breaking rainfall. Over the course of 12 hours, Dubai saw rainfall measuring 100 mm, or the equivalent of a year’s worth, according to UN data (by the day’s end, it increased to 142 mm). These floods disrupted all aspects of life, including a two-day interruption in the smooth functioning of the busy Dubai International Airport. When cloudseedingis undertaken, compounds that accelerate this process are releasedin clouds that are in the early stages ofthe precipitation cycle, either through ground- baseddispersors orvia flights. For example, accordingto UAE officials, ""natural salts"" are used, which do not harm the environment. It is a common practice across theworld, andit is not the first time that it has been blamedfor natural disasters. However, empirical evidence suggests avariable rate ofsuccess dependingon several factors. METEOROLOGISTS HAVE BEEN quotedthatsix-seven cloud seedingflightswereobserved over the UAE. Meteorologist Ahmed HabibtoldBloomberg thatsuch flightswereobserved on MondayandTuesday, and flight trackingdata accessedby theAssociated Pressalso revealedthatoneoftheaircraft relatedtothe UAE’s cloud seedingprogrammewas seen flyingon Monday. Butthe UAE’s National Center of Meteorology (NCM) saidthatsuch flights werescheduledfor Sundayand Monday, andalsotoldCNBC thatitdidn’tpartakein seeding operations beforethestorm.

On labour reforms The much-awaited four codes of labour reform are all set to be implemented by as early as after the national election. With the rollout of the four codes, the Indian economy is likely to see further uptick in economic development by creating a salubrious working atmosphere, fostering skill development, enhancing safety and security of workforce, among others. The incumbent government indeed accomplished a superb job by unifying and harmonising a plethora of central labour laws and placing them under the four codes on wages, social security, occupational safety, health and working conditions, and industrial relations. Nevertheless, quick notification of these codes passed by the parliament between August 2019 and September 2020 will go a long way in realising the desired objectives of the labour reform. - --Ashok Kumar Sahoo, Guwahati Status quo on rates - --Anthony Henriques, Maharashtra Write to us at feletters@expressindia.com © copyright: The Indian Express (P) Ltd All rights reserved.

On labour reforms The much-awaited four codes of labour reform are all set to be implemented by as early as after the national election. With the rollout of the four codes, the Indian economy is likely to see further uptick in economic development by creating a salubrious working atmosphere, fostering skill development, enhancing safety and security of workforce, among others. The incumbent government indeed accomplished a superb job by unifying and harmonising a plethora of central labour laws and placing them under the four codes on wages, social security, occupational safety, health and working conditions, and industrial relations. Nevertheless, quick notification of these codes passed by the parliament between August 2019 and September 2020 will go a long way in realising the desired objectives of the labour reform. - --Ashok Kumar Sahoo, Guwahati Status quo on rates - --Anthony Henriques, Maharashtra Write to us at feletters@expressindia.com © copyright: The Indian Express (P) Ltd All rights reserved.

"Prioritising price stability The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and its Monetary Policy Committee are more confident about the outlook for economic growth in the 12 months through March 2025, with the GDP expected to expand by 7% this year. For this, there arevarious factors from expectations of a normal south-west monsoon, thatwill boost agricultural activity and rural demand, to expectation of strong growth that gives the RBI the policy space to focus on tackling inflation. Sticky inflation has led to a sharp surge in personal loans for meeting essential expenditure. Price stability must be non-negotiable. -- Sanjay Chopra, Mohali Rare respite In a rare show of bonhomie, India permitted exporting essential items to Maldives for FY25, strengthening bilateral ties.

"WITHTHE GENERAL elections scheduled from April 19 to June 1, the model code of conduct came into effect from March 16. Amongst other things, the code bars the government from announcing policy decisions. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) asked for the Election Commission’s approval to implement the scheduled annual revision in user fees or toll taxes on national highways from April 1. The Commission quoted a provision of the code which bars any changes in power tariffs during elections, and asked the highways authority to maintain the status quo till the end of the elections. AS PART OF the annual revision exercise, the toll rates are slated to go up by 2.59% in FY25. According to some estimates, the losses due to the almost three-month hold on annual hikes would be around ₹100 crore a month. This assumption is based on the average toll collection of ₹4,500 crore a month. Average monthly toll collection of NHAI during April-June of FY24 was ₹4,406 crore. However, the ₹100 crore monthly loss number may not be material when toll collections are averaging ₹5,300 crore a month. In April- January of FY24 toll collection on highways touched ₹53,289.41 crore, much higher than the ₹46,998 crore collected in FY23. With this spike in monthly collections, the toll collections in FY24 are likely to have surpassed ₹64,000 crore. TOLLFEESARE calculated as per the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008. Under the rules, base rates for fee per kilometre for everyvehicle category using a highway of four or more lanes has been fixed at the 2007 prices. FY23 by 8-9%. In FY24 the toll rate for light motor vehicles and cars was ₹1.43 per km. On the expressways the toll rates are 1.25 times the user fee for a National Highway of four or more lanes. On two-lane highways, if the carriageway has been widened by at least 3 metres the toll is 60% of the four-lane rate. Bypasses costing over ₹10 crore (2007-08) are subject to a 1.5x multiplier.

Nobody should be allowed to stand from two constituencies because it means a by election and comes at a cost to the exchequer. -- Anthony Henriques, Maharashtra ●Write to us at feletters@expressindia.com © Copyright: The Indian Express (P) Ltd All rights reserved.

"performwellin FY24, this news comes as a relief. But how much attention should one pay to the statistics? To begin with, this is just a forecast which says that this monsoon will be 106% of the normal rainfall for the season, which is 87 cm at the national level. Curiouslyin the last 20 years, the IMD has almost always predicted a normal monsoon. This signal was not quite right on seven occasions, which gives a success ratio of around two- natives given that the rivers in the southern states are rain-fed. 6%.Inthreeoftheseyears,agricultural production was high in the range of 4- 6%, but still witnessed high inflation. This is interesting because it severs the relationship between output and prices. It is this facet which lowers the efficacyofthe announcementofa nor- mal monsoon. At the same time, there are always hikes in the minimum sup- port prices that are offered to farmers, which has an inflation potential. Even in commodities for destruction of the harvest. This has been seen not so much in case of crops but in horticulture. The annual onion andtomatocrisesarearesultofthelate departure of monsoon.

Coming as it does around two months before the arrivalofmonsoon, it could be still too earlyto gauge what would happen down the line. Technically,the monsoon arrives in June and departs in September. These four months are critical for the kharif crop, as on an average 60% of the cropped area is dependent on mon- soon. Given that the reservoir levels today are much lower than last year and the prevalent heat wave, it is even mal. In the remaining six years when growth was high, there were normal monsoons. Hence there is a posi- tive relation between good monsoon and crop output. It can be said that a normal monsoon is a neces- sary condition for a good agricultural out- put. While it directly affects the kharif crops, it also fills up In the last 10 years, agricultural growth was negative in one year while less than or just about 2% in three years. In these years, monsoon was below normal. In the remaining six years when growth was high, there were normal monsoons which there is nil or incaseofacropfailure.Butthisdoesnot hold for pulses where it was observed thatcountriesinAfricahikedtheexport prices to India once it was found out that there was a crisis internally. Climate change has been observed in India over the years with the season patterns being distorted. Monsoons rarelyarrive in early June; often itdoes atthe end ofthe month.The departure is also in October, which comes in the way of the rabi crop as farmers who grow two crops tend to go in for stub- ble burning, which has created other problems in northern India."
"Since the industry is prepared for a life without subsidy, the govern- ment should seize the opportunity to bring about some long-term reforms in the incentive scheme.Ratherthan reimbursing manufactur- ers for selling at subsidised prices, where a section of players were even found to be fudging numbers and indulging in certain other malprac- tices, the government should look at lowering theircost of manufactur- ing. This can be done by coming out with a modified production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme forthe automobile sectorbysubsuming the cur- rent subsidy given to two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and four-wheelers used for public transport. Currently, there are two PLI schemes for the more imperative that the rains are bountiful this season. Kharif accounts for around S0% of the crops that are grown (which excludes horticulture). The northern states arewell-equipped with irrigation facilities and hence there is less of a challenge for a crop like rice. But for pulses and oilseeds, the monsoon becomes more critical as there would be limited access to alter- the reservoirs which in turn provide water for the rabi crop besides cattle, fodder, and drinking purposes. ments are important.

Monsoon optimism The forecast for an above normal monsoon will come as a shot in the arm for India, which is largely dependent on the monsoons for agriculture. Abelow-normal monsoon could have proved to be the last straw that broke the camel’s back. There is much to be done to make the nation less dependent on monsoon. Water- guzzling crops like sugarcane must be discouraged in favour of other crops, which require less water and fetch better prices.

"Geologists can’t agree when the Anthropocene began, but it did A closer examination of the archaeological and historical antecedents of human impacts reveals that while humans have left an indelible mark on the natural environment over the ages, they reached a state of heightened activity only since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution C. P. Rajendran"
"cientists recently proposed formalising an ‘Anthropocene Epoch’ on the geologic time scale, triggering several debates. The earth’s geological history is divided into multiple epochs depending on their natural character. We are officially currently in the Holocene Epoch, which started around 11,700 years ago. But many scientists believe the Holocene Epoch has ended and the Anthropocene Epoch has started – a period of time characterised by humankind’s large-scale effects on the earth, including climate change and pollution. The proposal – to make the Anthropocene Epoch official – came from the Anthropocene Working Group of the Sub-commission of Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS-AWG). In the proposal, the group has said the start date of the Epoch can be linked to the formation of a particular layer of the ground. As the earth’s surface evolves, new layers of rock, soil, and other materials are deposited on old ones. Each layer, or stratum, is thus a marker of a previous era. The SQS-AWG is a commission responsible for recognising time units within our most recent period of geologic time. Its members have been looking into the question of formalising the Anthropocene Epoch as the youngest Plastic chemicals more than estimated: report Reuters At least 3,000 more chemicals are in plastics — from food packaging to toys to medical devices — than previously estimated by environmental agencies, a report published on Thursday found, raising questions over pollution and consumer safety."
"How long has the Epoch been under study? co-authored an article with marine biologist Eugene Stoermer in a newsletter. Here, he defined a putative geological epoch to mark the start of human’s transformation of the planet. Later, thanks to an article in Nature in 2002, Dr. Crutzen was able to garner wider acceptance for his neologism. He also suggested the onset of the Anthropocene Epoch coincide with the Industrial Revolution from the late 18th century. There are conceptual antecedents of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in older literature. In Man and Nature (1864), the American polymath George Pekins Marsh presented perhaps the first major, and prescient, discussion of the anthropogenic changes wrought by human activities. The Italian geologist and priest Antonio Stoppani, in a book published between 1865 and 1870, referred to an “Anthropozoic” era in stratigraphic terms."
"THE SCIENCE QUIZ The proposal also risked sowing confusion about the deep history of how humans are transforming the planet. The human impact was evident when the sabre-toothed cats began to disappear from North America and the woolly mammoths from Siberia about 10,000 years ago. Human activities also became more visible in the ‘fertile crescent’ of West Asia midway through the Holocene Epoch, about 6,000 years ago, with the rise of agriculture and deforestation to make way for farmland. Since then, humans have developed many technologies capable of manipulating the environment, including mechanisation, irrigation, groundwater extraction, damming, and the industrial production of nitrogen-rich fertilisers. Even around 1850, the concentrations of two major greenhouse gases, carbon As the earth’s surface evolves, new layers of rock, soil, and other materials are deposited on old ones.

"dioxide and methane, were rising at an accelerated rate. These compounds can modify the environment such that it becomes unfriendly to many forms of life. Significance of post-Industrial era? However, a closer examination of the archaeological and historical antecedents of human impacts reveals that while humans left an indelible mark on the natural environment over the ages, they reached a state of heightened activity only since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. For example, consider four important markers of the Anthropocene Epoch. The first is temperature – specifically, the predicted increase in the global average surface temperature, at least by 1.1 degrees but possibly by as much as 6.4 degrees C by the end of this century (which would be an all-time high since the last thermal maximum 40 million years ago). Second, the quickening extinction of various species at a scale similar in magnitude to a major extinction event that occurred 80 million years ago. Third, a dramatic increase in the erosion and the denudation of continents, at a pace an order of magnitude greater than what one would expect from purely natural processes. Finally, both accelerating urbanisation, land-use changes, and pro-urban migration have been accompanied by perennial water depletion and shortage. Over the last century or so, many major rivers that have been dammed and diverted have lost their water-carrying capacity. In fact, the argument that the rejection of the Anthropocene Epoch proposal is because of the fairly recent date of commencement and its shallow depth misses the larger picture. When Dr."

"THE DAILY QUIZ largest study, conducted in Andhra Measuring dierences The authors measured the differences in the survival rate between dialysis centres across India and evaluated the extent to which these differences are explained by centre-based characteristics. They found that centre- and patient- level characteristics are associated with survival, but there remains an unexplained variation between centres. In this study, one of the largest of its nature, over 23,600 patients, undergoing haemodialysis at any centre in the NephroPlus network, for 90 days or more, between April 2014 and June 2019 were chosen. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, measured from 90 days after joining a centre. The individual-level variables included sex, smoking status, history of diabetes, history of heart disease or heart failure, history of hypertension, hepatitis B and hepatitis C in patients. Besides this, other categories such as education, monthly household income, dialysis frequency and vascular access were factored in for evaluation. The centre-level variables included frequency of nephrologist visits, number of beds, number of staff and number of patients. Mortality rate After accounting for multi-level factors, the estimated 180-day survival ranged between 83% and 97%. The mortality rate in patients attending rural centres was 32% higher than those at urban centres. This latter figure was likely due in part to unmeasured differences in patient characteristics. Nevertheless, it highlights the unique challenges faced by rural centres, the authors aver. Among the patient characteristics associated with mortality were: There was an inverse relationship between mortality and dialysis vintage, with those receiving dialysis for at least a year prior to joining a centre having a 17% lower rate of mortality than those who started dialysis less than 30 days before joining. The presence of diabetes was associated with a higher mortality rate. By including centre-level factors in the analysis; for instance, staffing, processes of care and patient volume, they found it reduced the variability in survival across dialysis centres by 31%. The way forward The authors propose this as the first national benchmark for survival amongst dialysis patients in India. As India continues to widen dialysis access, ongoing quality improvement programs will be an important part of ensuring that patients experience the best-possible outcomes at the point of care. In future, it is clear that the number of patients in need of dialysis will increase. While overall improvements in health infrastructure and care are essential to keep pace with the demand, the authors of the study underline the need for a collaborative quality improvement system across the country. Alongside establishing national standards for dialysis outcomes in India, it is important to understand the multilevel effects of centre- and Therefore, establishing national benchmarks for dialysis outcomes against which the dialysis centres’ performances and changes over time can be compared is essential to drive this, they say, arguing that their findings present the first step in this voyage."

"uring the inter-zonal one-day tournament early this year, there was a day when South Zone captain Shreyanka Patil was having a poor day at the office. Her West counterpart, Smriti Mandhana, went up to her to console her and she broke down. “I can be myself around Smriti,” Shreyanka remembered. “I wasn’t happy with my bowling. She reassured me and said, ‘it’s okay. March 17th, you’re going to do it for us.’” True to word, Shreyanka would pick four wickets giving away a miserly 12 runs in 3.3 overs to help Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Delhi Capitals to lift its maiden Women’s Premier League title. Cricket is a game filled with characters of every variety. You have the quiet geniuses on one end who believe their sport and skill can do the talking for them. Then there’s this other bunch – loud, proud, happy to show their swagger on the field as much as they do off it. Shreyanka belongs to this second kind. After Richa Ghosh hit the winning runs, Shreyanka – along with a number of her teammates – was unstoppable. She was dancing constantly, coordinating group steps for the side; jumping on people, hugging people. It’s like no one was watching, no inhibitions, no limits. As the team posed by the champions’ photo op area, Shreyanka stood before it, dancing away to glory, like a little ballerina too immersed in her performance to have a thought for the world. “I just wanted to be myself. I told Smriti, please don’t stop me today. I just want to be myself. And she was like all yours,” she said. This was a marked difference to how her season began. The 21-year-old got off to an underwhelming start in WPL season two. In her first match (against UP Warriorz), she conceded 32 runs without a wicket in three overs. Against Gujarat Giants, she conceded 13 runs in a single over bowled. Against an imposing Delhi Capitals, she gave away 40 runs in three overs, getting a wicket too while she gave away 15 runs in two overs for a wicket against Mumbai Indians. “Shreyanka was the first one to come up and say, ‘I am not bowling well.’ She didn’t need me or anyone else to go to her with that... She came and asked, ‘I am not bowling well. What can I do?” She’ll come up with the solutions too. That’s her character,” Malolan Rangarajan, RCB’s assistant coach revealed after the Eliminator where the side beat Mumbai Indians for the second time. ▼ Shreyanka finished with the Purple Cap in the second edition of the Women's Premier League with 13 wickets in eight matches ▼ During a league fixture against Mumbai Indians, she sustained a hairline fracture in her left hand while trying to save a six.

In the final, she took four wickets and Molineux three to leave Capitals in tatters ▼ wicket-taker in the league"
"Regaining her mojo Incidentally, in the final, Shreyanka dismissed Lanning once more, a wicket that turned the face of the game. Shreyanka came into that game having missed two matches due to an injury to her hand. The break was a blessing in disguise not just in helping her get some time off but also in working on what was going wrong with her technique, if anything. Stir crazy Shreyanka did not enjoy life on the sidelines. Dev believes that it isn’t so much the person she dismissed as it was about her own sense of her technique that turned Shreyanka’s season for her. “When the small things go your way, it feels good. We focus on how it’s coming out of the hands,” Dev explained. “If she’s giving it enough revs, if she’s actually over-spinning the ball — these are small technical things that we focus on. She knows these things, how to look for them and correct them. She understands her bowling enough to do most of it herself. It doesn’t even have to mean"
"While Lanning’s wicket in the game was the first of four she would go on to take in that crunch league game, she was left in tears as RCB fell short by one solitary run, with teammates and opponents alike rushing to console her for a remarkable fight, irrespective of the result. In the Eliminator, much like the league game before that against the same opponent — Mumbai Indians, Shreyanka was fielded in the death, partnering Sophie Molineux and Asha Sobhana in keeping things tight and eventually helping RCB make the summit clash. She also took the key wickets of Hayley Matthews and Harmanpreet Kaur when RCB was defending a subpar 135 against an imposing MI batting lineup. “When you see things like that, you know that when there are crunch moments, these characters will stand up and deliver. Shreyanka is a warrior. Playing with a niggle, nobody will think she has an injury. These are characters we are very proud to have in RCB and we’re excited to see what she will go on to do for the club and the country,” Rangarajan said after the game. Shreyanka foxing Harmanpreet was no Ruke. She was happy to risk the MI captain switching into her trigger-happy mode if it meant she could draw out an error. Character development in CPL The significance of this Harmanpreet wicket and how it came about reminds Dev of how the duo plotted Matthews’ wicket when Shreyanka turned out for the Guyana Amazon Warriors in the Caribbean Premier League last year. She beat Matthews with a quicker ball which went too full and clipped her off stump. It"
"That tournament was transformative for Shreyanka in more ways than one. “CPL was a great experience for her in terms of growing up… just being the overseas player and having the responsibility helped her grow up a little bit. She’s always been looked after like a baby so this helped in maturing a bit in terms of the way she thinks about the game,” Dev said. He credits Stafanie Taylor, Shreyanka’s captain at the franchise, for much of it. “In domestic cricket, I don’t think R.V. MOORTHY"
"Ripple eect Dev points out how rubbing shoulders with the likes of Perry could go a long way in rounding out Shreyanka as an individual in a cut-throat sport like cricket. “There was a moment in the Eliminator where Perry dove by the boundary trying to stop a ball. She couldn’t and it went for four. She could have, per her own lofty standards. Anyone else would have hit the ground or said, ‘damn’ but not Perry. She picked up the ball and ran to her next fielding position. Those things go a long way. Your body language is picked up by these kids.

"mint primer Mid, small-cap fund tests: You shouldn’t stress NEIL BORATE & JASH KRIPLANI The results have come in from Sebi-mandated stress tests for mid- and small-cap funds. Days to liquidation range from 12 days for Franklin Smaller Companies Fund to liquidate 50% of the portfolio to 60 days for SBI Small Cap Fund. Mint decodes what the data mean for you. Stress test of top small-cap funds QUICK EDIT Putin’s mega win Small-cap scheme	AUM Days for pro-rata liquidation* Top-10 investors highest in Russia’s post-Soviet (₹ crore) 50% portfolio 25% portfolio (% in AUM) history.

"Why did Sebi mandate the stress test? Small- and mid-cap funds have seen a huge rise in flows over a few years on the back of high returns. Assets under management (AUMs) of small-cap funds rose from ₹1.06 trillion at the end of January 2022 to ₹2.49 trillion at the end of February 2024. For mid-cap funds, AUM has risen from ₹1.58 trillion at end-January 2022 to ₹2.95 trillion at end-February 2024. Thus, it has more than doubled for small-cap funds and grown 86% for mid-cap funds. The small-cap returns in the past year alone have been 46.73%. All this raised concerns around the ability of funds to handle a deluge of money, especially in a space that tends to have less liquidity. ISTOCKPHOTO 3 What methodology was used for the tests?"
"Should you be worried? There are some pointers that can make the results look rosy. First is exclusion of the 20% most illiquid stocks—the stress test is not on 100% of the portfolio. Second is the assumption of 3x volumes during panic selling. Such a surge may not happen. Third, the test tells you about the ability of the scheme to liquidate its portfolio—not how much the asset value can fall by. What can you as an investor do? QUOTE OF THE DAY As authoritarian and repressive regimes deploy technologies to"
"came up in 2020 when Franklin Templeton faced heavy redemptions on six of its debt funds and the company took a sudden decision to wind up the schemes. Investors were taken aback and the winding up ran into litigation. The process of liquidation was eventually handed over to SBI Mutual Fund. Investors also got back most of their money, but after having to wait for a few years. This happened with debt but it has never happened with equity in India. The decision to invest in large- or mid- or small-cap funds is a tricky one. It involves market timing— you are essentially predicting which segments will perform when. For example, mid and small cap stocks were outperformers in 2017, but underperformed in 2018- 20 before reviving in post- pandemic 2022-23. It is smarter to leave this decision to a seasoned fund manager by investing in flexicap funds, which can set the allocation between large, mid and small caps as per the fund manager. This is also tax efficient. undermine democracy and human rights, we need to ensure that technology sustains and supports democratic values and norms.

Even so, HPCL’s relative underper- formance does not make it appealing compared to peers if one has a more positive view on refining margin vis-à- vis marketing margin. While the gross refining margin (GRM) per barrel is not affected by the recent fuel price cut, it does squeeze the gross marketing margin (GMM). From consumers' point of view, the fuel price cut may not appear to be substan- tial as it is less than 3% of the prevailing prices in most states. While that augurs well, this time counted crude back then. Given all this, HPCL is facing a dou- ble whammy, making it the most vul- nerable among peers to the hit on mar- keting margin following the cut in retail fuel price. The best period for HPCL versus peers, therefore, may not be on the horizon anytime soon.

"“stack”, as technologists call the various layers of hardware and software on which AI relies to work its magic. On March 18th many companies up and down the stack will descend on San Jose for a four-day jamboree hosted by Nvidia. With talks on everything from robotics to drug discov- ery, the shindig will show off the latest AI innovations. It will also highlight furious competition between firms within layers of the stack and, increasingly, between them. thanhalf of handset-makers’ globaloperat- ing profits. Skimming the cream ing physical infrastructure needs to be built first in order for software to be offered. In the late 1990s, as the internet boom was getting going, providers of things like modems and other telecoms gubbins, such as Cisco and WorldCom, were the early winners. So far the host of the San Jose gabfest is by far the biggest victor. Nvidia accounts for some 57% of the increase in the market capitalisation of our hardware firms. The company makes more than 80% of all AI chips, according to IDC, a research firm. It also enjoys a near-monopoly in the net- working equipment used to yoke the chips together inside the AIservers in data centres. Revenues from Nvidia’s data- centre business more than tripled in the 12 months to the end of January, compared with the year before. Its gross margins grew from 59% to 74%. Nivdia’ chipmaking rivals want a piece of these riches. Established ones, such as AMD and Intel, are launching rival prod- ucts. So are startups like Groq, which makes super-fast AI chips, and Cerebras, which makes super-sized ones. Nvidia’s biggest customers, the three cloud giants, are all designing their own chips, too—as a way both to reduce reliance on one pro- vider and to steal some of Nvidia’s juicy margins for themselves. Lisa Su, chief executive of AMD, has forecast that reve- nues from the sale of AI chips could bal- loon to $400bn by 2027, from $45bn in 2023. That would be far too much for Nvidia alone to digest. As AI applications become more wide- ing mountains of data in order to teach algorithms to predict the next word or pixel in a sequence, to those needed actu- ally to use them to respond to queries, (“inference”, in tech-speak). In the past year about two-fifths of Nvidia’s AI reve- nues came from customers using its chips for inference. Experts expect some infer- ence to start moving from specialist graphics-processing units (GPUs), which are Nvidia’s forte, to general-purpose cen- tral processing units (CPUs) like those used in laptops and smartphones, which are dominated by AMD and Intel. Before long even some training may be done on CPUs rather than GPUs. Still, Nvidia’s grip on the hardware mar- ket seems secure for the next few years. Startups with no track record will struggle to convince big clients to reconfigure cor- porate hardware systems for their novel technology. The cloud giants’ deployment of their own chips is still limited. And Nvidia has CUDA, a software platform which allows customers to tailor chips to their needs. It is popular with program- mers and makes it hard for customers to switch to rival semiconductors, which CUDA does not support. Whereas hardware wins the value-ac- crual race hands down in absolute terms, it is the independent model-makers that have enjoyed the biggest proportional gains. The collective value of 11 such firms we have looked at has jumped from $29bn to about $138bn in the past 16 months. OpenAI is thought to be worth some $100bn, up from $20bn in October 2022. Anthropic’s valuation surged from $3.4bn in April 2022 to $18bn. Mistral, a French startup founded less than a year ago, is to OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s proprietary models, is open and can be tinkered with at will by others. In February Mistral, which has fewer than 40 employees, wowed the industry by releasing an open model whose performance almost rivals that of GPT-4, despite requiring much less computational power to train and run. centres and plenty of spare cash. Second, the buyers of AI services, such as big cor- porations, prefer to do business with established commercial parters than with untested upstarts (see chart 4). Third, and most important, big tech has the greatest potential to control every layer of the stack, from chips to applications. Besides designing some of their own chips, Ama- zon, Google and Microsoft are investing in both models and applications. Of the 11 model-makers in our sample, nine have the support of at least one of the three giants. That includes the Microsoft- backed OpenAI, Anthropic (Google and Amazon) and Mistral (Microsoft again). Have the layer cake and eat it Nvidia is becoming more ambitious, too. It has taken stakes in seven of the model-makers, and now offers its own AI models. It has also invested in startups such as Together AI and CoreWeave, which compete with its big cloud custom- ers. At its San Jose event it is expected to unveil a snazzy new GPU and, just maybe, AI tools from other layers of the stack.

FIcKlE FORTUNES or years, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Uni- lever (HUL) and Asian Paints were synonymous with equity market invest- ing. Of course, there were periods when the stocks remained comatose, but the consensus view was that one can never go too wrong by investing in India’s biggest private sector bank, the largest fast-mov- ing consumer goods (FMCG) firm and the biggest paints company. The three companies handsomely rewarded investors’ faith year after year, consistently expanding their market share, stamping their dominance over rivals and delivering healthy growth in earnings and stock price appreciation. But as they say, all good things have a sell-by date. 2023 was the first year when stocks of HDFC Bank, HUL and Asian Paints simul- taneously underperformed the Nifty50. Against the benchmark’s 20% jump, Asian Paints rose 10%, HDFC Bank 5% and HUL just 4%. Analysts say apart from common finan- cial ratios like price-to-earnings (PE), price-to-book (PB) and return on equity (RoE), investors should also pay attention to the biggest number out there—the company’s size. “Newcomers or smaller players tend to take away market share from them.

Last, the flexibility to change bill- ing cycles will help those with multi- ple credit cards. “The cardholder has to track both the statement and the due date for each card. Doing so for multiple cards can be cumbersome,” said Ansari. Cardholders should set the billing cycles for multiple cards in a way that all due dates fall on the same day. The maths behind the dues The idea behind giving the mini- mum payment due option to card- holders is that paying a small sum of the outstanding amount will save you from late payment penalty and fees.

Mint explains how these two provi- sions impact credit card users. Credit billing cycle Controlling the billing cycles of your card has many benefits. A billing cycle is the period between two con- secutive statement dates. A statement date is the day your credit card bill of the ongoing month is generated and this is done on a fixed monthly date. The due date to pay the bill is typically 10-15 days after the statement is gen- erated. This means that the card user With the option to change the bill-

Benefits of the bucket strategy: Goal-oriented approach: By allocating investments to spe- cific buckets, investors can align their portfolios with their finan- cial objectives. This clarity helps in determining the appropriate asset allocation and investment strategies for each bucket. Risk management: Segmenting investments into buckets based on risk tolerance allows investors to manage risk effec- tively. By segregating short-term savings and maintaining a con- servative approach, investors can safeguard funds required for emergencies. Meanwhile, long-term buckets can be more aggressive, aiming for higher returns and capital growth over time. Investors should build a portfolio with low correlation to protect the downside.

India’s top 1% own 40% of its total wealth, by one estimate, while the bottom half own just 3%. A recent UN report said the poor in India are unable to afford even basic necessities. Meanwhile, the wealth of the richest indi- viduals has risen sharply in recent years. Uncontrolled capitalism is failing the world’s largest democracy, just as socialism did. And just as the Land Ceiling Act of the 1970s was implemented to limit the size of landholdings and redistribute land, could a wealth ceiling law help reduce this gap? Critics argue that any income ceiling would disincentivize entrepreneurship and hard work, and that individuals may be less motivated to excel or invest in businesses, potentially stifling economic growth. They may also argue that foreign investment will dry up or talent migration will occur, and liberty infringement. But does it really penalize success? Also, what is the purpose of having more and more wealth? Here is how we could go about it. First, establish a frame- work for a wealth ceiling.

Subsequently, in the wake of the war in Ukraine, global supply chains for critical commodities such Their research investigated the reliance of the US’s manufacturing sector, particularly on Chinese intermediate products using input-output tables of the Organization for Economic Coopera- tion and Development (OECD). As per the formula used by Baldwin and others, we calculate two types of exposures. The first is ‘face-value exposure,’ which looks at the proxi- mate origin of intermediate inputs purchased by India’s manufacturing sector. The next is ‘look- through exposure,’ which cuts a layer deeper to understand where the intermediate inputs them-"
"selves are sourced from. To illustrate the use of these two measures, let’s take for example India’s electronics sector, which may source intermediate inputs from Vietnam. Face value exposure would take into account the reliance of India’s electronics sector on Vietnamese inputs. Now if Vietnam’s suppliers in turn rely on China for inputs, the look- through measure would capture India’s reliance on China (through Vietnam). The implication of a high look-through expo- sure is two-fold. First, it shows that protectionist measures may just end up lengthening a value chain, without reducing a country’s real depend- ence on a particular seller nation. Thus, even though a country may not be sourcing inputs at face value, these products may enter the market with minor modifications from third-party coun- tries— which the look-through exposure would capture. Second, sectors with higher look-through exposure to a nation would be more prone to supply-chain shocks as their reliance on foreign intermediates is higher than what is seen in terms of direct ‘face-value’ linkages. Exposure calculations for India for 2022 reveal that the foreign exposure of India’s manufacturing sector was around 17%, while 83% of the sector’s intermediate inputs were sourced domestically."
"since some of those foreign-sourced inputs might be critical. Indian sectors that are most exposed to foreign intermediates include basic metals, transport equipment, electrical equipment, coke, refined petroleum and nuclear fuel. Further, on a look- through basis, China on average accounts for 23% of all foreign inputs sourced. This is more than three times higher than the next highest supplier, the US, which accounts for 6% of all foreign inputs sourced. Our analysis shows that the story of India’s expo- sure to various nations, like the intricacy of GVCs themselves, is much more nuanced than what meets the eye. An exercise of understanding expo- sures along GVCs can improve risk preparedness by identifying the range of essential sectors that could be prone to geopolitical shocks.

"P R E E T H A N A I R @ New Delhi with stakeholders, said simul- taneous polls will spur develop- ment and social cohesion, deep- en “ foundations of the democratic rubric” and help re- alise the aspirations of “India, that is Bharat”. To synchronise the terms of the Lok Sabha and state assem- blies, the panel has proposed the insertion of Article 82A into the Constitution. It says that the new government which takes charge after the Lok Sab- ha election should set an ‘ap- pointed date’ to effect the con- stitutional changes. All the state Assemblies that are formed after the ‘appointed date’ would have their terms expire with the Lok Sabha. This newspaper was the first to report on September 26, 2023, that the 22nd Law Commission will suggest a 2029 timeline for synchronised polls to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies. The rollout of simultaneous elections will begin in 2029 if the newly elected government in 2024 accepts the Kovind com- mittee’s recommendations and introduces constitutional amendments in Parliament. The amendments don’t require a nod from state governments. Once the law is enforced, state assemblies formed between 2024 and 2028 will have their tenure curtailed to necessitate synchronised elections in the 2029 Lok Sabha polls. For instance, states such as Kerala, West Bengal, and Tamil “For synchronisation of elec- tions to the House of the People and State Legislative Assem- blies, the Committee recom- mends that the President of India may, by notification, is- sued on the date of the first sit- ting of the House of the People after a general election, bring into force the provision of Ar- ticle 82A, and that date of the notification shall be called the Appointed date,” the panel’s re- port said. The committee recommend- ed a two-step approach to hold- ing simultaneous elections. While the Lok Sabha and as- sembly elections should be held together in the first step, elec- tions to municipalities and panchayats should be conduct- ed within 100 days of its com- pletion. To hold simultaneous elections for local bodies, the panel proposed amendments to include the introduction of Ar- ticle 324A. It also recommended Article 325 of the Constitution be amended to enable a single electoral roll and single Elec- tor’s Photo Identity Card by the Election Commission. south Kolkata.

In the planner released for 2024, the notification was supposed to be released in February and the examinations were planned in June. In November 2022, the high- er education department re- leased a government order that dispensed with the system to appoint as- sistant professors based on marks pro- vided for teaching ex- perience, higher edu- cation qualification and interview. The GO stated that more than 55,000 doctor- ates have been awarded since 2015 and the government has given approval for opening of 182 self-financing arts and sci- ence colleges enabling job as- pirants to easily get experi- ence even for meagre salaries. Since many aspirants easily secure 24 marks (15 for teach- ing experience and 9 for edu- cational qualification), the method is not effective leaving interview performance as the major determining factor. Hence, the exam pattern was revised to 200 marks for writ- ten competitive examinations and 30 marks for the interview. The department, through another GO, stated that guest lecturers work- ing in government colleges who clear the open written competitive exami- nations shall be awarded a weightage of resolutions.

"PETER VIDAL 15th March : If we were to apply a little simple numerology to today’s date, then the day number is 6. As it happens this is a number of harmony, one which encourages us to make peace with family, friends – and ourselves. It’s a very positive moment for all bold, freedom- loving and independent spirits. What more could we ask? ARIES (Mar 21 - Apr. 20) As the Sun moves through its current position, it links up with a series of planets involved in professional and worldly ambitions in your career house. All hard-working and capable Ariens are about to benefit financially from their past efforts! TAURUS (Apr. 21 - May 21) The only chance of explosive GEMINI (May 22 - June 21) The Sun is shedding fresh light on parts of your psyche that other planets fail to reach. I would expect this to be a period which is punctuated by rather strange dreams, themselves the result of mysterious healing processes in your unconscious mind. CANCER (June 22 - July 23) One very subtle planetary movement today may have no recognisable results until another week has passed. However, you may like to know now that relationships at work are about to become warmer and more friendly. You may also be lined up for an extra community responsibility. LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23) The whole point about today’s ambitious, emotional and businesslike lunar alignments is that you will do best by following an entirely un-Leonine course of reserve and caution. The last thing you want is for domestic disagreements to flare up again. VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23) There is about to be a battle for supremacy between the Moon and Venus, two highly emotional planets. The result may be a certain amount of hysteria, and you may be as respon-sible for this as anyone else. Keep an eye on reckless and explosive feelings. LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23) Work away quietly behind the scenes on others’ behalf. If you are doing more than your fair share, please don’t feel hard done by or exploited. It is your destiny to put in more than you take out at the moment, so it’s only to be expected that you might feel unappreciated. SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22) The best that can be said about your SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 22) You’ll be wearing your affections on your sleeve today. Other people are likely to notice this and certain among them will look to you to provide them with security. Your emotional associates will be trying to turn you into some sort of mother hen. CAPRICORN (Dec. 23 - Jan. 20) You have spent too much time pondering the future. Now perhaps you should get on and make it a reality. Jupiter and Saturn are about to link up with other planets to form another key relationship in your long- term cycle, one which could shake you to your foundations. AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19) No one can tell you more about yourself of wisdom. PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar 20) Life is full of strange twists. What seemed like a financial reversal or climb-down may turn out to be just the opposite. Hopefully a promised windfall will materialise before long, although I am afraid that the size of such a reward is impossible to forecast. 3	9	7 8	6	2 7	4	3 1	6	7 7	2	1 6	4	5 3	1	5 4	3	8 8	2	5 CROSS WORD 23 Well-produced though initially crude (3) 24 Discounts are best Bets a week’s pay about being right (6) His performance may JUMBLE	UNSCRAMBLE THETSHEAJTUSMCBRLEASM,BOLNEEDLEWTOTERRDTGOAME ANDUJnEsFcFrKaNmURbEleK these Jumbles, one letter to each square, to form four ordinary words.

"Besides, according to Article 11 of the Constitution, it’s parliament that regulates the right of citizenship. The states are also bound to implement the laws passed by parliament. They can certainly challenge such laws, but they must do so by approaching the Supreme Court, which, as per Article 131, has the sole right to settle disputes between the different units of the Indian federation. Refusal to implement the law is not an option. Open declaration of their plan to resist would not work either. Parties issuing anti-CAA statements must understand they do not have the option of defying a law passed by both houses of parliament, even if they did not vote for it. That’s not how a democracy works. The only course of action if anyone indeed wants to block the imple- mentation of CAA is to convince the top court of the merits of their arguments.

AIAHL was established as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) on January 22, 2018, for owning and overseeing remaining non- core assets such as paintings and artifacts of the state-owned Air India, which was later ac- quired by the Tata group. After a prolonged five-year ef- fort to privatise the debt-ridden Air India, the government ac- cepted Tata Sons’ bid of `18,000 crore for the flagship carrier in October 2021. The transfer of ownership of the airline took place on January 27, 2022. The SPV, fully owned by the central government, was set up to man- age a working capital loan with- out asset backing, including four subsidiaries -- Air India Air  Transport  Services Ltd(AIATSL), Airline Allied Services Ltd (AASL), Air India Engineering  Services  Ltd  ( AIESL), and Hotel Corporation of India Ltd (HCI).

ENS ECONOMIC BUREAU @ New Delhi RATINGS  agency  Fitch  on Thursday revised India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast upwards for financial year  2023 - 24  ( FY24 )  and FY25 . The global agency changed FY24 growth to 7.8% from 6.9% in December 2023, and the FY25 estimate to 7%, from 6.5% a quarter ago on the back of strong eco- nomic growth. “With GDP growth having exceeded 8% for three consecutive quarters, we expect an easing in growth momen- tum in the final quarter of the current fiscal year, imply- ing an estimate of 7.8% for growth in FY24,” Fitch said. It described domestic demand and investment as the primary growth drivers, stating that short-term growth would sur- pass the economy’s estimated potential before easing towards the trend in the subsequent year. Real GDP is forecasted to increase by 6.5% in 2025-26.

Meanwhile,  it  revised down China’s 2024 growth forecast to 4.5% from 4.6% amid worries sur- rounding the country’s property market and deflationary influences. Despite these concerns, Fitch acknowledged in its report that Chinese authorities have intensified fiscal backing, mitigating the forecast’s reper- cussions. Besides this, Fitch has raised its 2024 global GDP growth forecast by 0.3 percent- age points to 2.4% in its report.

Concerns about AI While Indians expect emerging technologies like 5G (48%) and AI (46%) to have a positive ef- fect on society, there are con- cerns around the negative im- pact of humanoid and service robots as well. As much as 56% Indians stressed on the need for education to get prepared for AI and implement it responsi- bly. Respondents around the world expect AI to have nega- tive effects particularly in the areas of job losses due to auto- mation (53%), privacy viola- tions, and the manipulation of human behaviour (both 52%). The countries surveyed, in- cluding Brazil, France, Germa- ny, UK, US and China, are in agreement that AI will be the most important tech disruption going forward, followed by 5G and self-driving cars. Nothing like 2a R A K E S H K U M A R @ New Delhi RITISH tech firm Nothing has unveiled its latest smart- phone, the Nothing 2a, priced at `23,999. This is the com- pany’s third smartphone, which boasts of features that can impress users in this price bracket. We tested the DESIGN AND DISPLAY The phone resembles its predecessor, featuring a transparent back panel that allows glimpses of internal components. It sports a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with HDR10+ support, delivering enhanced dynamic range and contrast for HDR10+ compatible content on platforms like Netflix or YouTube. With a HDR10+ 120Hz refresh rate, the display ensures smooth system animations, scrolling, and responsive touch, completing the package. PERFORMANCE AND HARDWARE The Nothing Phone 2a is powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 7200 Pro chip with 8 cores. On the software front, the Phone 2a runs Android 14 out-of-the-box with the company’s Nothing OS 2.5 on top. For a mid-range phone, the Phone 2a handles everyday tasks well. Most users won’t feel the need for more power in daily use, though heavy users might sometimes feel limited. However, when playing heavy games with graphics, some glitches may be noticed. CAMERA The Nothing 2a comes equipped with a dual 50MP camera setup on the back. In the front, the phone has a 32MP lens. During usage, we came across some good clicks with accurate colors.

"HE US government’s lat- est efforts to crack down on the Chinese social me- dia giant TikTok reached a new tipping point in the election season. US House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that forces TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance six months to divest the US assets or face a ban. The move was taken over fears that the Chinese government may have access to the data of Americans who use the app, posing a national security threat for the US. It is still unclear if the US Senate will pass bill into law. The divestiture seems implau- sible at the moment given the app’s US business valued around $50 billion according to Bloomberg Intelligence esti- mates last year. The chances of major US tech giants potential- ly buying the viral app would also have to face regulatory scrutiny from competition watchdogs. Also, the support for the Pal- estinian cause in TikTok after the October 7 attack on Israel turned the attention on it. and bright colours.

"HE committee formed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has come out with the draft of the proposed Digital Competition Act. Apart from the widely re- ported ex-ante nature of the law as recommended by the panel, the draft law sets out rules of conduct for digital companies that meet pre- scribed thresholds and qualify as systematically significant digital enterprises. So who are these as Systematically Signifi- cant Digital Enterprises (SS- DEs)? According to the draft law, an enterprise may be designated as an SSDE if it has a significant presence in any of the Core Digital Services in India. An enterprise will be consid- ered as an SSDE with respect to a Core Digital Service, if it meets any of the following fi- nancial thresholds in each of the immediately preceding three financial years – (i) turn- over in India of not less than `4,000 crore, or (ii) global turn- over of not less than $30 billion; or iii) gross merchandise value in India of not less than `16,000 crore; or (iv) global market cap- italisation of not less than $75 billion or its equivalent fair value of not less than $75 bil- lion calculated in such manner"
"as may be prescribed. Apart from the above finan- cial conditions, a digital entity must also fulfil the following conditions in each of the im- mediately preceding three fi- nancial years in India to be considered as SSDE – (i) the core digital service provided by the enterprise has at least one crore end users; or (ii) the core digital service provided by the enterprise has at least 10,000 business users. Competition Commission of India (CCI), the anti-trust regu-"
"lator, can designate a company as SSDE even if it does not ful- fill the earlier mentioned con- ditions if it is of the opinion that such enterprise has signif- icant presence in respect of a Core Digital Service in terms of volume of the business, size and resources of the enter- prise, number of end users, economic power, etc. The government can, in eve- ry three years from the date of the law and in consultation with the CCI, may tweak the threshold for SSDEs.

The Centre’s notification of the CAA has changed the political wind in the partitioned state where the question of citizenship remains a lightning rod. The war of central and state guarantees also shows the gaps in services and entitlements left by some of the schemes"
"The race to capture the public imagina- tion is a competition between the BJP on the one hand and the Congress, regional and smaller parties on the other. The fight is in large part over the fulfillment of the guarantees the Modi regime offered in 2019 and the next round of guarantees he has offered across the country. In West Bengal, the guarantees of the Mamata government to deliver immediate relief and cash trans- fers to women, school-going students, un- employed young men and women, the sick and the old are part of the safety net she has put in place to mitigate the impact of poverty and access to opportunities. The guarantee-versus-guarantee fight, between the credibility of guarantor Modi versus other guarantor Banerjee, is a pat- tern repeated in states where regional par- ties are in power. It can be argued that this is competitive populism. It can also be ar- gued thatregional parties in power like the Trinamool are compelled to find ways of covering the deficits in terms of services and entitlements left behind by the Cen- tre’s policies and welfare programmes. This much was obvious from Modi’s speech in Siliguri, where he declared win- ning big in West Bengal in the Lok Sabha would be a stepping stone to winning the state in 2026. To get to 2026, the BJP and Modi need to engage with voters across West Bengal and link them to the larger arena of politics across the country, where the idea of double-engine sarkars and vi- kas have succeeded in various states.

Does the BJP look more set for the race than anyone else in the fray? Do you therefore see 2024 as a foregone conclusion? I don’t think they have done an- ything that they have not been doing in the last five years. He (PM Narendra Modi) is in cam- paign mode forever. So to that extent, I don’t see this as an aberration. I don’t have a crystal ball to make a prediction about who is going over their opponents. Not necessarily because they are early with their cam- paign, not necessarily because he (Modi) is hugely popular, not only because they have huge electoral muscle. It is because the Opposition has not been able to put their act together, certainly not well in time to raise a challenge. In a democracy, especially in a country like India, one should never underestimate the size or the opportunity for the Opposi- tion. A majority of Indians are always in opposition. No party gets more than 40% of the vote. It is not a subjective assess- ment. Just look at data from the last 75 years. Nobody has been able to get 50% or more votes in India. Meaning, whoever went to vote, more than half were not convinced with who you are, your policies, your prom- ises, your ideology. So, the Op- position is never weak in India. When you have close to 700 mil- lion people still not making `100 a day, you must not take the Opposition lightly. Sitting in the Deccan plateau, how realistic does BJP’s Mission South look like? “northern” party? I think it is an oversim- plification.

SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT AKHILA EASWARAN K. Lakshmi"
"There was a time when Chennai residents woke up to a chorus of chirping birds. House sparrows perched on the roof or terrace of houses were a common sight. Many houses in north Chennai now nurture these tiny birds in their balconies or backyards, thanks to D. Ganeshan, a professor-turned-IT professional. Popularly called ‘Kuruvi’ Ganeshan, this 35-year-old resident of Royapuram has been making and distributing nest boxes to schools and residents, especially in north Chennai. Hailing from a family of agriculturists, Mr. Ganeshan, who is the convener of ‘Koodugal’ (Network for Environment Sustainability Trust), was passionate about tree and soil conservation. “I learnt more about nature conservation and declining sparrow population during my college days. Sparrows are known as farmers’ friend and their population is an indicator of a healthy ecosystem,” he said."
"Reaching out to students He started executing social service projects after he became a professor in the college where he studied. “I realised that a safe habitat for sparrows would help to bring them back to urbanscape. I designed eco-friendly wooden nest boxes for sparrows and distributed them free of cost to households. But it did not work well. That was when I decided to reach out to school students to increase the critically declining sparrow population,” he said. He spent all his spare time sourcing raw materials and making and distributing nest boxes. “I started ‘Koodugal’ in 2019. I was initially supported by friends and wife D. Shanthini, who helped me create a website. My hope of saving sparrows increased when the birds began nesting in these boxes,” says Mr. Ganeshan, who learnt wood layout marking from a carpenter for a few days. It was not an easy task at first, for Mr. Ganeshan ran into lack of space, funds, and volunteers. He took permission from schools to conduct workshops and store finished nest boxes. He later formed teams to make kits. The organisation has reached out to 10,000 students and 35 schools with CSR funds and has started eight other projects, including bio-gas plants and digitalisation of rural areas."
"Population goes up “We have spotted an increase in the sparrow population by 10% in areas like Thiruvottiyur, Tondiarpet, and Royapuram, and have given nest boxes in other districts. The trust has identified sites to establish sanctuaries to allow sparrows to thrive in the urban areas. “I want to see at least two lakh homes in the city nurture sparrows in the next few years. I also want to take up healthcare and education projects through the trust,” Mr. Ganeshan says. The Hindu Bureau"

"Services interrupted A total of 1,330 transgender persons availed themselves of outpatient services at the clinic from June 2019 to February 2024, with the total outpatient census from 2009 being 1,536. From 2009, a total of 159 surgeries have been performed. They included 55 sex reassignment surgeries, 68 implants, and 10 mastectomy procedures, according to data provided by the department."
"Thorough preparation In a long-drawn process, a team of doctors work on the smallest of details before a transgender person undergoes a sex reassignment surgery. Doctors point out that while the clinic provides the community with multi-speciality care, the majority of transgender persons approach it for surgeries. “At the clinic, nearly 65% of the persons approach us for male-to-female sex reassignment surgeries,” says S. Vijay Kumar"
"estitution claims are the num- ber one desired result in any effort against the illicit traffick- ing of antiquities, and pre-theft in situ dated photographic evidence is pos- sibly the most important part of such claims.

"he RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has opted to keep the benchmark policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5% for a orld Health Day, which is observed every year on April 7, unites us around health equity, an essential topic at the heart of global health and justice. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared health to be a fundamental human right. The theme this year is “My Health, My Right”. There is an alarming gap in health-care access, highlighted by the COVID-19 epidemic, environmental crises, and growing socio-economic gaps. Even though over 140 nations recognise health as a constitutional right, the WHO Council on the Economics of Health for All reports that more than half the world’s population needs complete access to essential health services. With the passage of World Health Day 2024, it is clear that promoting health equity is a source of optimism for millions of people, going beyond social justice or legislative change."
"The meaning of health equity Health equity ensures that every person has an equal opportunity to achieve their highest health potential, no matter what their circumstances. Recognising that social, economic, and environmental factors impact health outcomes, this idea goes beyond genetics. WHO’s mission is to eliminate unfair and preventable disparities in health among different social and economic categories. For example, a child born into poverty in a rural area has no access to clean water, wholesome food, or immunisations, which lays the foundation for chronic health problems. The global challenges are: The fight for health equity confronts global challenges that transcend borders and call for collective international action. The COVID-19 pandemic has starkly revealed that infectious diseases target Professor Dr. Suneela Garg New Delhi Dr. K.S. Uplabdh Gopal is a health-care professional marginalised and vulnerable groups the most, thus widening the health equity gap. Climate change poses a serious health risk since it disproportionately impacts low-income and vulnerable people. The health-care provision is severely hampered by conRicts, which destroy infrastructure, uproot communities, and shut off access to vital medical services."
"India’s health equity challenge With a large and diversified population, India faces persistent obstacles to health equity, including notable differences in health-care outcomes and access. Even though access to health care has improved over the past 20 years, there is still much work to be done in rural India. According to the 2011 Census, urban slums make up over 17% of India’s metropolitan areas, and exhibit serious health disparities. Health risks are increased by overcrowding, poor sanitation, and restricted access to clean water. Infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, are 1.5 times more common in slums than in non-slum areas, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for more than 60% of all fatalities in India. The Public Health Foundation of India points out the necessity for equitable treatment access and preventive health care, stating that the economic effect of NCDs could surpass $6 trillion by 2030. Governments and officials may inRuence the state of health through funding, creative policies, and laws. For instance, India’s Ayushman Bharat initiative provides free health coverage to the bottom 40% economically, demonstrating a commitment to reducing health disparities. The National Health Mission (NHM), which includes both the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM), reduces the health-care gap between rural and urban India by expanding access, strengthening infrastructure, and providing essential services to vulnerable populations. Achieving health equity requires raising health literacy. India should turn health equality into a shared, community-driven goal by including health education in the NHM, enabling its people to seek equitable care and make educated health decisions. Together with the government, the public and private health-care sectors provide services to underprivileged communities, emphasising preventive education, workforce development, and infrastructure enhancement. Non-governmental organisations and civic societies engage in direct community outreach to draw attention to and resolve regional health concerns. Their collaboration with international and governmental organisations allows them to tailor health initiatives that are culturally sensitive to the community’s unique needs. International institutions such as WHO, the Global Fund, and Gavi support health initiatives in places with limited resources and promote sharing information and resources to enhance health-care systems, especially in countries such as India."
"Tap these organisations Organisations with a strong local presence are essential for health equity. They actively participate in every phase, from planning to evaluation, to guarantee the relevance and effectiveness of health programmes. They also have a thorough understanding of their community’s requirements. Effective collaboration among many sectors, ranging from policymakers to grassroots	 	 organisations, may significantly enhance health equity and pave the path for a time when access to high-quality health care would be a shared reality rather than a privilege.

"There is no single factor Suicide is a complex human behaviour and it is futile to locate a single causative factor. Suicide in young people is best understood as multidetermined and the result of interaction between biological, psychological, familial, and social cultural factors. There are specific sociocultural factors for suicide among young girls and women. Arranged and early marriages, young motherhood, low social status, domestic violence and economic dependence are well documented.

"No young lives should be lost by suicide in India due to silence and inaction implicated. Failure in examinations drove 2,095 people to suicide in 2022. A system of education with an emphasis on scoring marks, and a one-point examination system, along with parental pressure and high expectation from oneself and the educational institutions contribute to suicides. Enormous competition to get into colleges, media hype around results, the shame associated with failure, and The media has a strong inRuence on vulnerable young people. Sensational reporting of suicide, particularly by a celebrity, is followed by increased suicidal behaviour. Following the death of a very popular young male actor in India, there was a significant increase in searches on Google on “how to commit suicide”."
"There are solutions The view that suicides cannot be prevented is a commonly held one as people believe that it is an individual’s choice. Or it is because of socio-economic factors which are beyond their control. For an overwhelming majority of young people who engage in suicidal behaviour, there is often an alternate, appropriate resolution of their problems. Young people can be taught problem solving, impulse control and emotional regulation skills along with improving help-seeking behaviour. Early identification of mental distress and provision of care in a youth-friendly environment are essential. and reduces suicide in the young. Improving the family environment by reducing domestic violence and alcohol consumption, and providing economic assistance to the needy have been shown to reduce suicidal behaviour. Educational reforms such as alternative assessment methods and provisions to explore the potential of a Political will, intersectoral collaboration and commitment, and community participation are needed."
"A strategy that needs more visibility The Ministry of Health constituted a task force in November 2019 to develop a National Suicide Prevention Strategy for India. The final strategy was launched on November 21, 2022 with the objective of reducing suicide by 10% by 2030. The immediate task is to disseminate the strategy to all States in India and stakeholders. Budgetary allocations are necessary and the strategies need to be implemented at the earliest at the State, district and community levels.

"niversal health coverage (UHC) signifies universal accessibility to comprehensive, On December, 12, 2012, the UN General Assembly unanimously endorsed a resolution urging countries to accelerate progress towards UHC. In India, the high level expert group report, submitted to the Planning Commission in 2011, outlined a government intent to increase public financing for health to 2.5% of India’s GDP during the 12th Plan (2012-17). The economic growth of the country makes this increase feasible. The National Health Policy, 2017 articulates “the attainment of the highest possible level of good health and well-being, and universal access to good quality health care services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence” as its goal, which aligns with the UHC target."

However, the Directive Principles of State Policy in Part IV of the Constitution provides a basis for the right to health.

"The two critical components of the UHC policy — strengthening primary healthcare and reducing out-of-pocket expenditure — demand focused attention of living, and to improve public health. The Constitution not only mandates the state to enhance public health but also endows the panchayats and municipalities to strengthen public health under Article 243G. The theme of International UHC day is ‘Health for all: Time for Action’ and of World Health Day is ‘my health – my right’. How should access to health be envisaged? Given that health is a state subject and the UHC policy is envisaged at the national level, there is a need for discourses on implementation. India has a large migrant population: the total number of inter-State migrant workers was about 41 million (Census 2011), and the total migration rate was 28.9% (Periodic Labour Force Survey, 2020-21). With 49% of the population living in urban slums, according to UN-Habitat/World Bank, the focus should be on ensuring the availability and accessibility of primary health services. Isaiah Berlin spoke about two types of freedom. The first is ‘freedom from’ or negative freedom; the second is ‘freedom to’ or positive freedom. ‘Freedom from’ means the absence of obstacles or constraints, whereas ‘freedom to’ recognises the possibility of autonomously determining and achieving individual or collective purposes. The discourse on health as a human right must be seen as the second freedom, where every citizen has the possibility to achieve health and wellness as part of their rights to access to public health. The constitutional right to health is critical to breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and poor health that will otherwise continue to perpetuate inequality in all spheres of life, including education, opportunity, wealth, and social mobility.

"The health tech context In recent years, the health technology industry has seen rapid growth and innovation.

This rise in health technology is not just a trend, but a need arising out of a common purpose of having a sustainable future. One of the main benefits of incorporating technology into healthcare is its potential to improve access to, and affor- dability of, healthcare.

"illions of Indians underwent trau- matic experiences while seeking treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This strongly underlined the ur- gent need for two complementary streams of change in our healthcare sys- tem: strengthening public health services and regulating private healthcare providers. In the Indian context, no initiative for reforming the health sector will be complete without touch- ing upon private healthcare, which accounts for around 70% of healthcare utilisation in the country. This setting underscores the relevance of policy recommendations contained in the recently published Jan Swasthya Abhiyan’s 18-point People’s Health Manifesto. It con- tains a wide range of inter-related policy re- commendations covering diverse themes including public health services, the private healthcare sector, pharmaceutical policy, and the right to universal health care. Here, I brieRy outline some key measures con- cerning the private healthcare sector in India."
"Transparency, standardisation of rates Private healthcare providers are perhaps unique among all the commercial services in India, since the rates of their services are generally not transparently available in the public domain. This is linked with the wide spectrum of rates that may be charged for the same procedure or treatment, not only by various hospitals in the same area, but also from different patients within the same hospital. The Clinical Establishments (Cen- tral Government) Rules, 2012 specify that all healthcare providers must display their rates and should charge standard rates as determined by the government from time are yet to be implemented. The Supreme Court has recently inter- vened in this matter, asking the Union Health Ministry to standardise healthcare rates as per the law. It is high time that tran- sparency of  healthcare  rates  be ensured, and standardisation of rates be implemented in an ap- propriate manner. This is techni- cally feasible, keeping in view that thousands of private hospitals routinely accept reimbursement at standard rates for practically all common medical procedures, as It is also necessary to implement stan- dard protocols to check irrational health- care interventions, which are currently pro- moted on a wide scale due to commercial considerations. For example, the propor- tion of caesarean deliveries in India in priv- ate hospitals (48%) is three times higher compared to public hospitals (14%). In priv- ate hospitals, the share is far in excess of the medically recommended norm for caesa- rean sections (10-15% of all deliveries). Ra- tionalising treatment practices and curbing excessive medical procedures will not just bring down excessive bills charged by many private hospitals, but also significantly im- prove healthcare outcomes for patients."
"Implement patients’ rights Given huge asymmetries of knowledge and power between patients and hospitals, cer- tain rights are universally accepted to pro- tect patients. These include the right of ev- ery patient to receive basic information about their condition and treatment, and the expected costs of care and itemised bills; the right to second opinion, informed consent, confidentiality and choice of pro- vider for obtaining medicines or tests; and ensuring that no hospital should detain the body of a patient on any pretext. In the Indian context, the National Hu- man Rights Commission formulated a set of A private hospital. SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT"
"patients’ rights and responsibilities in 2018. Such a charter was circulated by the Union Health Ministry to all State governments in shorter form in 2019, and then in a more comprehensive form including 20 patients’ rights in 2021. However, given the lack of of- ficial attention given to these rights until now, the complete Patient Rights Charter (not a diluted version as observed in some hospitals) must be effectively enforced in all healthcare facilities across the country, so that patients and their caregivers can ob- tain care in a conducive environment. Creating such a secure setting would also help to rebuild much-needed trust between patients and providers. Further, given the failure of existing me- chanisms like Medical Councils to ensure justice for patients with serious complaints related to private hospitals, it is important that user-friendly grievance redressal sys- tems be operationalised from district level upwards, with multi-stakeholder oversight."
"Control commercialisation of colleges Along with these measures on private healthcare, some complementary steps concerning medical education are men- tioned in the manifesto. There is an urgent need to control commercialised private medical colleges, especially mandating that their fees must not be higher than govern- ment medical colleges. Further, expansion of medical education must be focused on public colleges rather than commercialised"
"These vital measures for reforming priv- ate healthcare in public interest should be part of wider processes for developing a pu- blic-centred system of universal health care, based on major expansion and streng- thening of public services, while engaging regulated private providers as per require- ment. Drawing upon successful models such as the healthcare system in Thailand, such a system in India could provide rights- based access to free and quality healthcare to everyone. Today, all political parties should com- mit themselves to implementing these transformations, while as citizens we must strongly demand them. This would be a fit- ting manner to celebrate World Health Day in India in 2024.

This means that the number of men contesting has multiplied five times; for women, the growth has been 16-fold. Gender-wise data are not available for the first Lok Sabha election in 1952. A perusal of the EC data shows that in the second Lok Sabha election in 1957, of the 45 women candi- dates in the fray, 22 won, indicating a 48.88% suc- cess rate. That has de- clined consistently ever since; in 2019, women’s success rate was just 10.74%, as only 78 of the 726 women candidates won their seats. In the case of male can- didates, their winning per- centage dropped from 31.7% in 1957 to just 6.4% in 2019. This is not, however, a marker for any trends in the winnability of men and women; it simply reRects the fact that the number of candidates of both sexes has grown even as the number of seats in the Lok Sabha remained the same, experts note. “This just shows the ma- turing of the Indian de- mocracy and the fact that more and more women are entering the fray,” says pol- itical analyst Tara Krish- naswamy, co-founder of the NGO Political Shakti.

"I have a dilemma with regard to gold 50% + equity 50% port- folio against bonds 50% + equi- ty 50%. On the face of it, it appears gold has a natural hedge against any in- Rationary pressure that might hit bond portfolio while providing a good cush- ion for low-cost borrowing. However, I want to understand these portfolios from these risk perspectives: short, medium (10Y), and long term (20Y). BALAN"
"here are a few things you need to understand about gold, if you are considering it as an in- vestment. Gold is definitely a hedge — not necessarily against inRation — but against the volatility of other asset classes like equity and at times debt. Gold has historically been preferred in periods of economic crisis when equi- ties tend to tumble or when sovereign bonds lose value. So, essentially gold is expected to do well when others are down, thus providing some downside protection to your portfolio. If you take the rolling 1- and 3- and 5- year returns of gold against bonds bet- ween 2014-24 YTD (we took the ICRA Composite Bond Index and ICRA Gilt Index for this purpose), the bond in- dices have beaten gold on rolling 1-year and 3-year returns and matched gold over 5 years. Besides, the standard de- viation of gold (the swing in gold prices from their average for a given period) is significantly higher than bonds. Finally, the probability of negative re- turns in gold over 1 and 3-year periods is higher than bonds. Also, the quan- tum of fall in gold is much higher. For example, the worst returns in gold ov- er rolling 3-year periods for 2014-24 is -8% as opposed to 4.4% for the Compo- site Bond index and 5% for Gilt.

"ven though the claims process is the most critical aspect of your policy, yet, at the actual time of filing, it might be akin to navigating a com- plex maze. Whether it’s term or health insurance, any diffi- culty in getting the claim means that it’s the policy- holder who ends up bear- ing the brunt of the pro- cess, which eventually erodes the trust in the in- dustry. It is, therefore, bet- ter to be informed and pre- pared with practical solutions for whatever the claims process holds for you."
"Lack of understanding Limited understanding of insurance policies is a com- mon problem faced by pol- icyholders. It might not al- ways be clear what the complex jargon or insu- rance terms mean. In fact, Policybazaar’s data suggests that close to 50% claims in health insu- rance get rejected due to a lack of understanding of policies. Policyholders should take the time to thoroughly review their insurance pol- icy documents, paying close attention to key terms, coverage limits, and exclusions. To help con- sumers navigate this pro- Policyholders should take the time to thoroughly review their policy documents, paying close attention to key terms, coverage limits, and exclusions"
"Gathering  documents The claims process typical- ly requires policyholders to submit various docu- ments to support their claims, ranging from medi- cal records and receipts to police reports and witness statements. The process might also vary from one insurer to another. The first step should be to approach the insurer for grievance redressal. If you are unable to arrange a particular document, dis- cuss with them a possible alternative for it. Make sure you submit the originals of documents pertaining to identity and In the case of health and term policies, ensure that your	nominee/family members are well aware of this folder since they’ll be the ones who’ll be re- quired to take care of the documentation."
"The regulatory body is increasingly making con- sumer-centric policies to simplify the insurance pro- cess for policyholders. In fact, if the resolution is unsatisfactory, you can also approach the IRDAI regarding the same. If your claim ends up being reject- ed and your concern re- mains unresolved, you can also intimate your concern to the insurance ombud- sman within one year of the claim rejection. However, to prevent the situation from getting to this stage, it’s better to maintain a proactive line of communication with the insurer."
"Lack of transparency Insurance is a product that works on utmost good faith and so, trust and tran- sparency are non-negotia- ble elements of this pro- duct. This just doesn’t apply to insurance compa- nies but also to policyhol- ders. For instance, data al- so suggest that out of rejected claims, 25% are due to non-disclosure of pre-existing diseases like Diabetes or Hypertension by policyholders. It’s important that both insurer and policyholder are transparent in their dealing and disclose all ne- cessary information to avoid rejection of a claim. While insurance compa- nies should clearly lay out the terms and conditions applied to the policyhol- der, the latter should also reciprocate the same by disclosing crucial informa- tion like pre-existing condi- tions, smoking habits or other lifestyle choices that may have a direct impact on your claim. In a nutshell, it is impor- tant to understand the pol- icy terms clearly, organise documentation, and main- tain open communication with the insurer.

Keerthivasan Having enjoyed a career-high of World ranking of 24 in 2019, Sathiyan was going through one of the worst times of his professional table tennis career four years later."
"Devastated The best part about Sathiyan is his keenness to improve and introspect when the chips are down that separates him from others. “I started to focus more on recovery, an area I neglected as a youngster. I started doing ice bath, massages, strength training and physiotherapy. My routine was recovery, fitness and practice. Once I started to do that regularly, I was feeling better and then I started to build on it,” explained Sathiyan. Raman, too, has played a huge part in Sathiyan’s career. The 54-year-old Olympian encourages Sathiyan to challenge his coaching style and there are instances of the two challenging each other on the best way to go forward as far as technique and fitness were concerned. “Raman sir went back to the basics."
"In the singles semifinals against Chuang in Beirut, Sathiyan was on top of his game in counter-attacks and blocks. During long rallies, the Indian was consistent and was excellent in defence and in unleashing forehand top spin winners when it warranted. Sathiyan defeated Manav Thakkar in the final and the next day without a break, he played in the WTT Feeder II in Beirut, where he reached the semifinals. Sathiyan revealed that he was able to play back-to-back tournaments because of the training routines provided by Sankar. “There was not even a day’s break. After the WTT Beirut I event, I started playing the next day. Six days of continuous playing. I have not done it before, playing in two Feeder events back-to-back,” he said."
"According to Sathiyan, the changes in the points system by World Table Tennis also played a part in his rankings going down. “WTT announced in January that only points accrued from June 2023 will stand and not the usual two-year period,” he said. Sathiyan further emphasised that WTT stopped allowing any window for training in its calendar unlike earlier times when there was a window for training and practice that helped players to recoup. in-between tournaments,” he said. The last three years, said Sathiyan, has been non-stop with major tournaments. With three events — Tokyo Olympics (2021), Commonwealth Games (2022), Asian Games (2023) and now the Paris Olympics (2024) — he said, there was hardly any time for recovery, one of the many reasons that led to him being injured. “This was the first time that three big events happened every year, 2021, ‘22 & ‘23. It was a huge challenge. I am happy that I have recovered and progressed well,” he said. Whenever Sathiyan has lost his form, he has relied on smaller events to bail him out. After a poor show in the Tokyo Olympics, he won the ITTF Czech Open as the top seed. This time, when he was again down and out, he took part in the WTT Feeder event in Beirut and won it. On the rationale of participating in lower tier events when he loses his touch, Sathiyan replied, “I think for me, the concept is to play more matches. In Feeder events, you get to play more matches. In Contender events, the level is"
"high and you directly play at a high level. When you are not in good form, you either play a tournament in India or play a Feeder event. That’s the best way to progress and gain confidence.” However, he said Feeder events are becoming tougher as players outside the top 30 in the world play and the competition is high. “The Feeder events concepts have changed. Though there are no World top 30 players, six players from 31 to 50 are allowed. Feeders are as good as Contender events,” he insisted. The two-time senior National champion wants to improve his singles rankings and enter the top 50 in the world to brighten his chance of sealing a spot in the men’s team event for Paris Olympics. That, though, will not be easy. Even though Sathiyan is ranked two behind Sharath in International rankings, he is ranked five in Indian (domestic) rankings and are two others breathing down Sathiyan’s throat. “It’s a tight race in men’s. Manav Thakkar (63), Harmeet Desai (66) and I are neck-to-neck in world rankings. It’s a healthy competition. We will know the composition of the team when the Table Tennis Federation of India announces it on May 16,” he said. Sathiyan is also eyeing a berth in mixed doubles with Manika Batra for the Paris Olympics when the two-day World mixed doubles Olympic qualification tournament begins on April 11 in Havirov (Czech Republic). “We are ranked 16 in the Race to Olympics rankings. Four pairs from Havirov will directly qualify. The qualification (for Olympics) looks difficult. We are confident of putting up a fight,” he said. Setbacks have always got the best out of Sathiyan. He will be hoping he will come out, unscathed. GETTY IMAGES THE GIST"

"kin, with its wide spectrum of textures, hues, and histories, has long captivated the imagination of poets and storytellers. It has served as a canvas for the expression of beauty, identity, and cultural symbols. The diversity of skin colour across human populations is a product of human genetics, the migration of peoples, and the complex interplay between genes and the environment. Together with its colour, skin opens a window into the underlying human pathophysiology, and not just because it’s the largest organ — and has, as a result, been the subject of many scientific and medical investigations as well.

Scientists widely believe exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun has been the dominant driver of skin colour throughout history. Across geographies, colours have also displayed a close connection to latitude, which in turn is correlated with ultraviolet exposure. This said, systematic approaches to understanding and documenting skin colour have only been of recent interest. In 1735, the Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus classified humans into four “varieties” based on skin colour. The Austrian anthropologist and explorer Felix von Luschan designed a scale with which to compare skin colour in the 19th century. The scale has 36 colours and is used to this day."
"A few genes As for modern-day human skin colour: the prevailing hypothesis is that it’s the result of natural selection across a few genes. Two of these, SLC24A5 and SLC45A2, are the most well-studied. They affect skin colour in modern Eurasians. Other genes like MC1R, TYRP1, and OCA2 affect that of East Asians. And all of them show signals of natural selection. Some evidence has been found for natural selection in Europeans around 11,000–19,000 years ago.

"There are many exceptions to this general rule, however. For example, the Inuit people who have inhabited Alaska for more than five centuries, have darker yellowish brown skin compared to other populations at the same latitude. This has been a puzzling exception for many years. Researchers have hypothesised a high vitamin D intake and high ultraviolet exposure due to longer days have combined to create this anomaly."

"Volcanic vortex rings emerge from a new pit crater on the north side of the southeast crater of the Etna Volcano in Sicily, Italy, on Friday. While the physical conditions under which volcanic vortex rings form are still not entirely known, scientists believe they are the result of a combination of fast gas release at the top of the magma conduit and regularity in the shape of the emitting vent. AP In ecology, ‘gape limitation’ stands for the idea that a predator can only eat things that fit in its mouth. Gape limitations also influence how animals evolve over time. Prey animals might get faster or grow bigger to avoid being eaten by predators with smaller mouths. On the other hand, predators may evolve larger mouths to eat larger prey. Understanding gape limitations is essential to predicting how changes in predator or prey populations, changes in habitats, and/or environmental disturbances could affect the structure and function of Small predators can only eat small prey, while bigger predators can eat bigger prey.

The port remained open to trucks following the incident, but the loss of maritime traffic is expected to cost $9 million a day. The overall economic toll is likely to be higher as billions of dollars of goods are rerouted amid the prospect of supply chains being snarled for months.

"The story so far: emiconductor chip manufacturing capabilities are currently limited to very few regions in the world. With supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and recent geopolitical tensions, many companies and countries, including India, have realised the importance of investing in chip manufacturing infrastructure. The TATA group has partnered with Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) to set-up a 300mm wafer fabrication plant in Gujarat. It will roll out its first 28nm chip in 2026. Two assembly and test plants in Gujarat and Assam have also been recently approved by the Government of India."
"What is a semiconductor chip? How is it manufactured? The process is crudely analogous to creating an intricate work of art on a paper or a wall, by using a bunch of stencils and spray paints of different colours. The stencils are called ‘masks’ in the industry and the paint is analogous to the dopant. What is a transistor? The transistor, one of the earliest electronic components to be built using a"
"THE DAILY QUIZ semiconductor, is an extremely versatile device. In its most popular form it can function as an electronic switch. A typical semiconductor chip can have millions/billions of these interconnected switches that work together to perform various logical and computational operations. A transistor can also function as an amplifier (to amplify the weak signal received by your cell phone) and is an integral part of circuits that generate and process high frequency signals (such as those required in wireless communication technologies). Today all these different avatars of the transistor are routinely packed into a single semiconductor chip (such as the WiFi chip in your mobile). The transistor demonstrated how a single device could be built out of a piece of a semiconductor. ‘Printing’ multiple devices onto a single piece of a semiconductor to create entire circuits was the next leap. Both these breakthroughs laid the foundation for the semiconductor revolution and have been aptly recognised by Nobel Prizes (in 1956 and 2000)."
Sticking with the stencil analogy this is mainly due to the stencils being able to etch smaller and more intricate patterns. There have been equally impressive gains in the switching capability of the transistors. They are able to switch on-and-off faster (more computations per second) and with lesser power consumption (longer battery life and lesser heat dissipation).
"What is known as a wafer? A semiconductor chip is manufactured much like a postage stamp. A sheet of stamps is printed on a piece of paper and then each individual stamp is cut out. Similarly, an array (typically 300-400) of chips are printed on a circular piece of semiconductor (called a wafer in industry parlance). This is then diced to create individual chips. A larger wafer size allows more chips to be printed on a single wafer which makes chip production faster and cheaper. Wafer sizes used in the industry have constantly been increasing. The current state of art is 300mm which is approximately 12 inches (this refers to the diameter of the wafer). Efforts are ongoing to move to a 450mm wafer size. While moving to a larger wafer size has its technical challenges and capital expenses, it has proven to be economical in the long run. Once the wafer has been diced into chips, each individual chip has to be What does India’s semiconductor ecosystem look like?

"Yes, it can. It is much more common, however, to hear the word being used as a noun. We very often hear people say, ‘I take a bath around seven in the morning’ and ‘During summer, I have a bath twice a day’. The British and the Americans tend to spell the word differently when it is used as a verb. The Americans tend it spell it ‘bathe’ — the ‘ba’ rhymes with ‘may’, ‘hay’ and ‘say’, and the final ‘the’ sounds like the ‘th’ in ‘though’, ‘this’ and ‘that’. The British, on the other hand, do not make a distinction between the noun and the verb forms of the word — both in terms of pronunciation and spelling.

The English, on the other hand, rhyme the second syllable with the words ‘cost’ and ‘lost’. In both cases, the stress is on the second syllable. There are some people, who when they are criticised, come up with a quick, witty response. This clever comeback or response is referred to as a ‘riposte’. This word of French origin, which can be used both as a noun and a verb, comes from the sport of fencing — the quick thrust that a swordsman makes is called a riposte. On April 8, 1911, superconductivity was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. A quiz on superconductors Be careful with Veda.

Superconductors also demonstrate one other common trait: they expel . Fill in the blanks. X QUESTION 2 Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was awarded the physics Nobel Prize two years after 1911 “for his investigations on the properties of matter at low temperatures”. Name the process Onnes used to liquefy gases, a prerequisite for these discoveries. X QUESTION 3 In 1986, Georg Bednorz and Alex Muller found that lanthanum barium copper oxide became a superconductor at 35 K — a big jump from the 23 K record until then. In 1987, the American Physical Society invited the duo to present their findings at a meeting. This meeting has since been called the “X of physics” for the excitement it generated. What is X? X QUESTION 4 Scientists have found that when two sheets of graphene are stacked such that their bonds are parallel, and then one sheet is twisted by an angle of 1.1 degrees with respect to the other, the system acquires the properties of a superconductor. What is this angle called? X QUESTION 5 When a superconductor spins, it generates a magnetic field whose axis aligns perfectly with the spin axis. Name the NASA satellite launched in 2004 that used this effect to test two predictions of general relativity."

"Promise or perish Parties need to oGer more than welfare schemes in their manifesto All this raises the question. Is safety paramount for the Minister and the DGCA? Or are the commercial requirements of airlines taking priority over passenger safety? Going by the actions so far, air passengers should be aware that they are Rying ‘purely on a horoscope’. The authorities and the airlines are clueless on safety standards."
"Systems overseas Why has the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) introduced the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) as a mandatory requirement? It is with good reason. The study of various accidents and serious incidents due to fatigue, has shown sleep deprivation and impaired reaction times to be identified as a major cause. Countries such as Japan, Singapore Captain A. (Mohan) Ranganathan"
"With airline managements in India appearing to prioritise commercial needs over passenger safety, the Civil Aviation Ministry and the regulator need to act and the United Kingdom lay a lot of stress on fatigue management and also rest periods for Right crew. They follow a system where pilots get two days off every week to reset their body clock and recover from cumulative fatigue. For long haul Rights, they are provided augmented rest on return to their home base. The common refrain one hears is that pilots are overpaid for the work they do, when even senior executives in airlines earn less! In 1985 when I was part of the Central Executive of the Indian Commercial Pilots Association, this was the argument put forth by the Director of Personnel and Director Finance of the airline, that is Indian Airlines (IA), to deny pilots an increase in emoluments. I highlighted the huge difference between the working conditions of pilots and ground personnel. Pilots got just 30 days of annual leave and a day off every week due to FDTL limits. Contrast this with ground personnel who got weekends off, which is 104 days, all public holidays and their annual leave. I told the IA management that pilots would forego the increase and would also work the same number of days that ground personnel did in office. People fail to understand that a pilot is a human being and not a machine. He or she needs time with their family too. Two days off in a week is a must to be with family."
The human factor is distant Why are airlines looking at copilots as only an occupant on the Right deck? They are the airline’s future captains and are a long-term investment in an airline’s growth. The human resource departments of airlines have failed. Airlines are bound to lose even their captains who will move to an airline that operates with human values.
"Some solutions Retired pilots can be utilised for simulator training. Such a step will also release a large number of trained pilots for active Rying Hanging on to rules that were drafted in 1937 and a system that has large-scale corruption will never result in Indian aviation shining. As for the Tatas, if they want to make their merger of four airlines result in a trouble-free world class airline system, they need to introspect deeply over the importance of the human factor in aviation. Finding excuses such as ‘Air Traffic Control delays’ for large-scale Right disruption — as Vistara cited— will cut no ice. It is transparency	 	 and building brand loyalty that will help them regain their past glory in aviation. Perverse intent The CAA suGers from narrow definition of persecution and arbitrariness"
"ffering citizenship to migrants who have Red their countries of origin because of persecution and have stayed a sufficient The argument by petitioners against the CAA in the Supreme Court of India that the rules of the Act do not require foreign applicants to effective- ly renounce citizenship of their native countries, and that this allows for the possibility of dual citi- zenship which is directly violative of the Citizen- ship Act is also fair even if it is only a procedural one. While India is not party to the 1951 UN Con- vention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the he Indian Army is observing the year 2024 as the ‘Year of Technology Absorption’. The absorption will be mainly in terms of disruptive technology (DT) comprising artificial intelligence, autonomous weapon systems such as drones, sensors, robotics, space technology, and hypersonic weapon systems. Several nations, led by the United States and China, have remarkable accomplishments in the field of DTs. The strategic competition and engagements in the future are going to be inevitably decided by the edge a nation possesses in absorbing these technologies. To begin with, time-tested weapon platforms and tactics are here to stay, even with the induction of DTs. It is more about discovering a practical use of the new discoveries rather than about the discovery per se. As said, integration as part of absorption wherein the new DTs complement existing platforms is crucial. Complimenting legacy systems Although the new technologies could significantly alter the character of future wars we must still refrain from being lulled into complacency because of the mere acquisition of technology. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Colonel Shashank Ranjan (retired) is an Infantry Officer having served in the Indian Army for almost 33 years. He teaches at the O.P. Jindal Global University, Sonepat, Haryana"
"The Indian military is moving in the right direction, but the challenge lies in sustaining technology absorption with a nuanced understanding of the requirements The strategies that military organisations use to employ technologies will be critical in understanding their effects on the battlefield. Also, as we have seen in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the initial benefits that Over a century ago, armies developed tactics that reduced their exposure to enemy fire by exploiting dispersion, cover and concealment. Such practices hold even more importance in the current era."
"Rather than discarding conventional platforms in favour of purely digital solutions, the technology and its attributes need to be at the centre of planning for future plans. This will be a process that starts with the acknowledgement of vulnerabilities and sensitivities and the gap between them. An understanding of the latest technologies, their potential, and the context in which they can be utilised are essential. The absorption will have to visibly manifest itself at the unit levels, as against being controlled only at the higher levels. This democratisation in employing technology at cutting-edge levels is an imperative to usher in true transformation. Technology absorption will also necessarily include several macro level aspects such as organisational restructuring, the management of human resources and cultivating specialists not merely at the higher levels but also decentralised at execution levels, civil military fusion, having a structure and policies to ensure data integrity, and having a procurement policy that is applicable to DTs. The Indian military is moving in the desired direction but the challenge will be to sustain this with a nuanced understanding of the requirements as applicable. In this context, there are many lessons from recent and ongoing wars, and should not be lost sight of."

Changes and implications One change in the new HCES is the updated item coverage, which has been done keeping in view the latest consumption behaviour. Another significant change is the splitting of the single questionnaire into three parts covering food items, consumables and services items, and durable goods. The three questionnaires have been used at random in a selected household during three separate monthly visits contrary to the past when the team would G.C. Manna"
"visit a household just once. Using the single questionnaire during one visit often resulted in long interviews. As a result, respondents were fatigued and there was a possibility of under-reporting consumption expenditure, particularly in respect of items like durable goods which were placed towards the end of the questionnaire. While the latest change will help us derive more reliable estimates of the average MPCE, we are also now unable to compare the current estimates of the average MPCE, and the share of poor that may be derived from it based on the survey data, with the estimates of the past, given the likelihood of under-reporting of household consumption expenditure in the previous surveys. A third change is in the method of stratification of villages and urban blocks for the purpose of sampling. While in HCES 2011-12, every district was considered as a basic stratum for rural and urban areas, the new HCES considers a State/UT as the basic stratum. While every district with some minimum sample allocation got represented in both the rural and urban samples of the 2011-12 survey, the new HCES does not ensure the same. Such a change does not affect the generation of State-wise estimates. There is also a change in stratification of households. All the households of a selected village/urban block are classified into three groups depending on a criterion. The criterion in rural areas is possession of land and in urban areas it is possession of four-wheeler cars for non-commercial use on the date of the survey. The total sample of 18 households with proportional representation from the three groups have been selected. Given that the proportion of urban households possessing get ensured in such States as intended. It is worthwhile to note that the said stratification in the HCES 2011-12 was based on the average MPCE of the households with the top 10%, middle 60% and bottom 30% forming the three strata, and a sample of two, four, and two households, respectively, was allotted to these strata.

At 36, she continues to be one of stalwarts in women’s cricket. And she is a double international, having played for New Zealand in basketball at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She spoke to The Hindu over phone from Hamilton. Excerpts: Q: How exciting was it to bowl New Zealand to that last ball victory in the third T20I against England recently?"
"A: It was one of the most exciting finishes to a game that I have bowled in. It was pleasing to be able to get the win after a tough start to the series. So yeah, it was super exciting. Unfortunately, we haven’t been able to beat them again, but it felt great to be able to do a job with the ball. You have played before and after women’s cricket became professional. What kept cricketers like you going in those days when there was not much money or publicity or television coverage, and how difficult those days were?"
"Initially I never expected to be a professional athlete. It was something I loved to do, playing sport. And I played a lot of sports growing up, and I got picked for the New Zealand women’s cricket team at 18, and I didn’t even think about getting paid for or even the potential to be paid, so it was all about loving playing for my country and getting the opportunities to go to World Cups. I saw it as a privilege not just to go to those World Cups and not have to pay for them and get paid to travel the world with my friends. So, it’s a very different world now, and I just feel that I am very fortunate that I got to experience both the amateur and professional sides of the game. That kind of kept me going, and now internationally, we are full-time professionals, and I think having been in a completely amateur era, I now want to make the most of getting paid for something that I used to do pretty much for free. CM So, it was my dream job when I started and not getting paid, and now it is my dream job and I get paid. How did players like you make a living during those days when there was no money at all in cricket?"
"It was a totally different world. As a female athlete, you didn’t expect to make money. It was never an aspiration, and when I was young, from 18 to 24, I studied, and we got grants from the government to study and play sports to help pay for our living allowance. What keeps you going?"
"I think it is just the love of being part of the White Ferns. And I still feel like I can contribute to any team I play in. And I know once I am retired that you are a long time finished. And I have always felt that when I stop enjoying not only the playing but the training and I feel like I am not able to contribute, then I’ll give it away. But I feel like I have always found ways to keep contributing. And I have always loved it and probably always will love it. And so it is that feeling of knowing that when you call it time, that you are never going to be able to do it again. And that motivates me to keep getting the best out of myself. There’s always World Cups and pinnacle events just around the corner that I think I can contribute to this team. And I’m still motivated to win a World Cup. And those are the little things that keep me going. What are your memories from playing in the Olympic Basketball in 2008? The fondest memories from that game?"
"I remember, growing up, I used to watch a lot of American sport on TV. And to play the USA women’s basketball team, who were the best in the world at the time, was pretty special, to try and compete with them. And just singing the national anthem at an Olympic Games was really cool. And to rub shoulders with some of the best athletes in the world. There were the likes of Roger Federer, Michael Phelps and LeBron James at those Games. To be in the same space as them as a young 19-year-old was really inspiring. Cricket is included in the 2028 Olympics at Los Angeles."
"It is so exciting for the growth of the game, not only women’s cricket, but men’s as well. And yeah, the Olympics have changed drastically over the years in terms of the sports that we play. So yeah, it is great for the growth of the men’s and the women’s game globally. You would be 40 then. You feel you might still have a second Olympics in you? Oh, it would be an amazing feat if 20 years after my first one, I could participate in a different sport. If I am fit enough and I am playing well enough, we won’t put it out of the question. Looking back at your career, what do you consider have been the highlights?"
"As a cricketer, winning a World Cup, I think is the pinnacle, but we did not. Early on in my career, we came second three times and, you know, that was a failure to me. But now that I look back on that, the fact that we played in three World Cup finals is an achievement in itself. Playing at Lord’s in that 2020 World Cup final, although the game went terribly for us, was a real highlight. It sounds, I guess, a bit strange, but just to be a part of the White Ferns in a fully professional era from where we came from has been a real highlight for me to be a part of that and just watch the game grow in New Zealand. It makes me really proud that I have been through both eras and yeah, we haven’t won a World Cup. And that is what I have always been driven to do. So those World Cups early on were disappointing. But if I can do that before I retire, I will be one happy cricketer. The toughest bowlers you have faced over the years? A: I was actually talking about it the other day to the girls. I found the combination of Katherine Brunt and Anya Shrubsole relentless."
"Karen Rolton was probably the first female cricketer that I was almost wowed by in terms of how hard she hit the ball, but she didn’t play for that much longer when I started. And unfortunately, Meg Lanning scored a ton of runs against New Zealand. And as I was captain, she scored so many hundreds and I could never come up with ways to get her out. She was just so determined and I found her the hardest batter to prepare for in terms of captaincy. Favourite male cricketers?"
"Two athletes that used to make me stop and watch them were Michael Jordan and Sachin Tendulkar. Whenever those two people were on, I just was fixated on the TV. I loved Tendulkar’s presence at the crease. I loved the amount of runs he scored. And he was the one batter that I remember just always wanting to watch. What is the state of women’s cricket in New Zealand now? How has it evolved over the years from the time you were a little girl?"
"Now I go back to Dunedin, we have a full-time coach in Craig Cumming, who works tirelessly with all the players. We have up to 20 to 25 people turn up to our team training. We have assistant coaches. Just the number of young players that are now playing want to get contracted and play first and foremost for their regions in the Super Smash and now the White Ferns – it is just so different. You know, players are recognised everywhere they go in Dunedin, the Sparks players, whereas back in the day, it was very rare anyone knew any female cricketers. So the depth that we are creating through putting women’s cricket on the television and young girls wanting to be cricketers, it is so different. You can’t even measure the difference that there is now to when I first started. And probably that is why I am still here. S CH-CHE II	Tuesday, April 9, 2024"
"SCIENCE A freak DNA change 25 million years ago is why humans lack tails Around 25 million years ago, the chance insertion of a transposable element occurred in a gene in the zygote of an ancient creature. The probability of the insertion occurring in that exact region was around one in a million. Yet it did, causing the creature to not develop a tail, a study has found Arun Panchapakesan Chennai"
"ne of the most striking anatomical features of apes, which sets them apart from monkeys, is the absence of a tail. All mammals have a tail at some point during their development, but apes, including humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons, lose them in utero, leaving behind three to five vestigial vertebrae called the coccyx, or tailbone. Apes started to lose their tails in this way around 25 million years ago, when the ape and monkey lineages split from a common ancestor. And until recently, nobody knew why apes started to do this."
"The compact genome Every cell of an organism contains a full copy of that organism’s DNA, called the genome. The genome contains the information that the cell uses to make proteins, the workhorses of the cell. Each protein is coded by a specific section of the genome, called the gene. Not all cells make all the proteins encoded in the genome. For instance, pancreatic cells make insulin, but skin cells don’t. Skin cells make other proteins, such as keratin, that the pancreas cells don’t. A cell achieves this selective protein production by first making a temporary copy of the gene, called the mRNA, that then drives protein production. So pancreas cells will first copy information in the insulin gene into insulin mRNA, and the insulin mRNA will be used to make insulin protein. Skin cells follow the same process to make keratin.

"It promised to be North America’s biggest eclipse crowd ever, thanks to the densely populated path and the lure of more than four minutes of midday darkness in Texas and other choice spots. Almost everyone in North America was guaranteed at least a partial eclipse, weather permitting. “Cloud cover is one of the trickier mid-1990s, they realised simple organisms like bacteria keep their genomes very compact while more complex life forms don’t. In the bacterial genome, the genes are arranged in tandem: where one gene ends, another begins. As a result, genes make up 85–90% of the bacterial genome."
"‘Junk’ DNA But in complex organisms, genes are spaced far apart. In humans, for example, only 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins. At the time, scientists didn’t know what the rest did and called it ‘junk’ DNA. Today we know this ‘junk’ DNA is responsible for various functions, including controlling when to make a protein and when not to. A significant fraction of the ‘junk’ also contains transposable elements. These are pieces of DNA that can shift their positions within the genome. For example, if it happens in an essential gene, only that cell will die;"
THE SCIENCE QUIZ others around it will function normally. The sole exception to this rule is if the insertion happens in the zygote: the fertilized cell after fusion of the sperm and egg that develops into the offspring. Then the change to the DNA will be permanent: it will be reRected in every cell of the offspring.
"The Alu accident Twenty-five million years ago, after the ape and monkey lineages separated, a chance insertion of an Alu element occurred in an important gene in the zygote of an ancient creature. The probability of the insertion occurring in that exact region was around one in a million. Yet it still occurred, and it caused that ancient creature to not develop a tail. New York University (NYU) scientists reported the discovery of this fateful insertion in a paper in Nature in February. As scientists began to determine the genome sequence of organisms, they realised simple organisms like bacteria keep their genomes compact while more complex life forms don’t It was eventually found hiding in the ‘junk’ DNA. A tailoring defect The NYU group found the Alu insertion between two pieces of a gene called TBXT The researchers proceeded to compare the size of the TBXT mRNA produced in human and mouse stem cells. They found that while the mouse mRNA was intact, a"
"An unfinished tail The NYU team, led by Prof. Itai Yanai, Prof. Jef Boeke, and PhD student Bo Xia, engineered the embryos of mice to produce a defective version of TBXT — the version found in apes. As if by magic, the resulting mice were born without tails. The team also determined that the defective TBXT protein caused other problems, including neural tube defects. They predict that there must have been compensatory changes to the genome to overcome these defects. Some of them could be the differences they themselves identified in the proteins involved in tail formation. Despite the excellent work of the NYU team, we may never fully understand the tale of our tail. Tail loss has been implicated in bipedalism: our ability to walk on two legs. But it is difficult to speculate on exactly what evolutionary benefit was conferred on the ancestral tailless ape that led to its selection by nature. Whatever that selection pressure may have been, what is incredible is how evolution seized upon that one-in-a-million event and used it to create an ape that would go on to rule the world.

Essentially the mosquito receives an electric shock, just like we might if we were hit by lightning on a stormy night. The mosquito bat is thus, a portable thunderstorm for the mosquito “ Cop it (S. Lalita, Palghat)” “ ‘Cop it’ is an informal expression which means ‘get into trouble, be punished,’ ‘be killed.’ You will cop it for what you have done. He will cop it from his wife for not remembering her birthday. ‘Cop’ has several meanings. As a noun, it means ‘a policeman,’ ‘a capture or arrest.’ He is a nice cop. She was copped for shoplifting. ‘Cop out of something’ is ‘to go back on a promise, to fail to do what one ought to do, especially through fear.’ ‘Cop-out’ is a noun. ‘Not much cop’ or ‘no cop’ means ‘little or no value or use.’ She is not much cop as a writer. He is no cop as a singer. Perhaps this expression is used only by American lawyers and judges.” “In the picture (C.C. Jacob, Nagpur).”"

"Complete the circuit The bat’s working principle is simple. There are three metal meshes. The one at the centre is positively charged and the outer ones are negatively charged. When the layers don’t touch each other, current cannot Row. But when a mosquito connects them, a current passes through and kills the insect. Essentially the mosquito receives an electric shock, just like we might if we were hit by lightning on a stormy night. The mosquito bat is a portable thunderstorm for the mosquito. The"
"THE DAILY QUIZ physics of sparks and lightning is the same, whether it’s in your gas lighter, in the belly of storm clouds or in the mosquito bat. So the question arises: why do electric sparks — like a bolt of lightning — look white? If this is the ‘colour’ of electric current, shouldn’t the current Rowing through electric wires at home also be white? Yet they aren’t."
"Batteries and shocks Electric current is carried by electrons, the negatively charged fundamental particles that usually revolve around positively charged protons in every atom. Every atom has an equal number of protons and electrons, rendering them electrical neutral. In any piece of metal such as copper, there is a large number of atoms but every atom also shares some electrons with other atoms. The whole material still remains neutral but these common electrons can freely move from one atom to the other, and conduct current easily. negatively charged electrons Roating together. A battery generates electric force. How much electric force is generated depends on the battery’s volt value. Higher the voltage, greater the force. For example, the pencil battery that powers our wall clocks is usually 1.5 V. A phone battery has a comparable range. These are strong enough to drive currents through clocks and phones but not strong enough to give humans electric shocks. That’s why you don’t have to worry when holding them in your hand. On the other hand, the current supplied to our household appliances comes with a voltage of 220V, which is enough to electrocute us. During a thunderstorm, the voltage can cross a hundred million volts, powering electrons to Ry through the air."
"The ‘colour’ of electricity Strong voltages ionise and pull electrons away from atoms. These unhappy atoms then try to get their electrons back. If the electrons do go back, they need to lose the ‘excess’ energy they have, and they do this by emitting light. Every time the electron loses some energy, the light has some wavelength. In the case of air, the light the electrons lose is in the range of wavelengths human eyes can see. And this light is what we see. The colour of the light and the spark depends on the type of atom. In fact, this Interestingly this is also the physics which goes into the working of a tube light but in a slightly different way. Circling back to the mosquitos and our mosquito bats: how much voltage do these devices generate? It’s around 1,400 V — equivalent to approximately a thousand regular batteries, and enough to drive a powerful electric current through the mosquito and at the same time drive electrons out of atoms in the air nearby, thus creating the sparks we see. In case you are also wondering how certain wavelengths of light can be emitted by certain atoms: it is only by learning quantum mechanics can one understand this. So if you are interested, consider pursuing a course in physics. And the next time a mosquito troubles you and you end up using the electric bat with crackling success, just remember: it’s not just you. Quantum physics, electrons, and the atoms in the air are all joining in to celebrate your victory."

In its pitch for a third term, the BJP argues that continuity of a strong, stable government is es- sential in steering the country through a period of global instability.

But do budgetary allocations in the Union Budget corroborate this assessment? We try to answer this by looking at the trend in welfare spending over the past 20 years. We compare expenditure on what we label “NDA schemes” with United Progressive Alliance (UPA) or “UPA schemes”. Contrasting models? For the PDS, we use the food subsidy.

"The NDA government has managed to project itself  as a big welfare spender by renaming pre-existing UPA programmes but has been underfunding them without any compensatory social assistance of its own For Ujjwala Yojana we use the LPG subsidy (as with the food subsidy), though only a small part of it is spent on Ujjwala Yojana. The chart includes five major “NDA schemes”: SBA, PM-Awas, LPG subsidy, PM-Kisan and the JJM. Some have contrasted the UPA with the NDA, The NDA schemes follow a saturation approach that allows an element of self-targeting — only those who cannot get work at higher wages than NREGA show up for it and children in government schools and angwandis tend to be from poorer families."
"On how welfare spending has changed Let us, nevertheless, keep the distinction for now. The chart shows expenditure in the Union Budget on “NDA schemes”, “UPA schemes” and the combined total. The level of welfare expenditure (top line) is low and stagnating, in spite of good GDP growth in this period. It exceeds 3% of GDP only once (in one of the two COVID-19 years). In contrast to the NDA schemes, none of which available). The proportion of households practising open defecation has halved (from 39% to 19%) and those residing in ‘pucca’ homes barely changed (from 56% to 60%). It is precisely because the NDA lacked imagination that during COVID-19, it fell back on UPA initiatives, including NREGA which was mocked in 2015 by the Prime Minister as a symbol of the Congress’s failures. The NDA’s fraught relationship with UPA schemes is evident in the case of the PDS/PMGKAY too. The NFSA 2013 mandated 50% coverage in urban areas and 75% in rural areas (i.e., 800 million in all), providing five kilograms a person a month at ₹2-₹3 a kg (for wheat and rice, respectively) for those covered by the PDS. From April 2020 to December 2022, the government doubled people’s entitlements (from five kilograms each month to 10 kg, providing the extra five kilograms free) as COVID-19 relief."
"State initiatives The silver lining is that several State governments, especially those ruled by regional parties, have stepped up to the plate. For instance, while the Union government has barely increased per child cooking costs for school meals, even poorer States such as Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha provide for eggs a few times a week in the MDM"

Two-horse race New data law, a barrier to journalistic free speech Karnataka is seeing a straight contest between BJP and Congress"
"lmost a year since the Siddaramaiah-led Congress rode to power in Karnataka with a thumping majority of 136 seats out n August 2023, India got its first comprehensive data protection law, the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023. The government is in the process of framing rules and regulations to operationalise the law and the process is expected to be done after the general election. The law is largely based on users giving consent for the processing of their personal data. It provides basic rights such as access to and erasure of data, places some obligations on companies, and establishes a complaints body for grievance redress. However, the law might have an invisible impact on journalistic free speech."
"An impediment Now you may ask, what does privacy have to do with journalistic free speech? Imagine that you are a journalist writing about a Member of Parliament (MP) and his performance. For your story, you use information from their lives such as the meetings they held, where, and with whom, the towns, villages, and cities they travelled to. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Shashank Mohan is Programme Manager at the Centre for Communication Governance, National Law University Delhi"
"In the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, the removal of ‘journalistic exemption’ highlights the need for more robust public consultation protected under the DPDP Act. Consequently, any journalist who wishes to use this data will have to get their consent before publishing the story. Even after publication, the MP can exercise their right to erasure and request journalists to delete such stories. Further, the DPDP Act empowers the government to call for information from any data processor in India. Depending on how this provision is interpreted and applied, this may impact the confidentiality that journalists must maintain for their sources and research documents. Taken together, this need for journalists to get consent before publishing their story, the potential for the subject to rely on the right to erasure to have the story deleted, and the power of the government to call for information would likely impede a journalist’s ability to discharge their role as the fourth estate — of holding the state accountable. If this is a well-identified challenge, then why did the government remove such an exemption from subsequent drafts? This remains unclear. Three previous drafts of the DPDP Act, one released by an expert committee on data protection (2018), the other by the government (2019), and the third released by a Joint Parliamentary Committee in 2021, contained clear exemptions for journalistic activities. In two subsequent drafts of the DPDP Act (2022 and 2023), the exemption given to journalistic activities was withdrawn without reasons being given."
"No clarification a law is to institute an ‘open and transparent’ public consultation model. Although the Indian government released three separate drafts of the data protection law for public consultation, none of the comments received on the drafts has ever been released in the public domain. This impedes the ability of citizens to understand what different stakeholders were saying and who was finally heard in the final formulation of the law. The government has also conducted invite-only town halls to gather feedback on drafts of the DPDP Act. The withdrawal of exemptions for journalistic activities was not discussed in such town halls. And, no clarification was provided by the government for its withdrawal. Unfortunately, these consultations and town halls are often not conducive to enable open debate and deliberation on the proposed law and its provisions.

"While the Indian government seems keen to benefit from seabed mining and resource exploitation in the Arctic, it ought to unequivocally back a sustainable mode of extraction exacerbated by the suspension of various regional cooperative forums. There are concerns about the potential repercussions of these tensions, especially given Russia’s growing reliance on its nuclear deterrent on the Kola Peninsula. For India, which aims to maintain constructive relations with both western nations and Russia, these developments carry significant strategic implications. To be sure, India is no newcomer to the Arctic. Its involvement in the region goes back to 1920, with the signing of the Svalbard Treaty in Paris. In 2007, India undertook its first research mission to investigate Arctic microbiology, atmospheric sciences, and geology. A year later, India became the only developing country, aside from China, to establish an Arctic research base. After being granted ‘observer’ status by the Arctic Council in 2013, India commissioned a multi-sensor moored observatory in Svalbard in 2014 and an atmospheric laboratory in 2016. The work at these stations focuses on examining Arctic ice systems and glaciers and the consequences of Arctic melt on the Himalayas and the Indian monsoon. Potential for collaboration Norway, the present chair of the Arctic Council, has close ties with India. Since the late 1980s, the two countries have collaborated to investigate changing conditions in the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as their impact on South Asia. As climate change ends up more deeply affecting the Arctic and the South Asian monsoon, these efforts have accelerated over time. India’s present policy is to cooperate with Arctic countries in green energy, and green and clean industries, as a way of bolstering its ‘responsible stakeholder’ credentials. With Denmark and Finland, for instance, Indian collaboration has come in areas such as waste management, pollution control, renewable energy, and green technology. Understandably, a partnership with Norway is likely to be focused on scientific research and climate and environmental protection. These are two of the six pillars that comprise India’s Arctic Policy (the other four being economic and human development; transportation and connectivity; governance and international cooperation; and national capacity building). India would perhaps still look to explore economic opportunities in the Arctic. Norway could, then, help India design a sustainable policy that accommodates the needs of both the scientific community and industry. As global geopolitical tensions are also mounting in the Arctic, finding constructive and non-sensitive ways to alleviate pressure will be in the interest of both India and Norway."

What share of global CO2 emissions come from aviation? FROM THE ARCHIVES Hannah Ritchie Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions.

"lying is one of the most car- bon-intensive activities, yet it contributes just 2.5% of Increased demand and techno- logical improvements have driven the change in aviation emissions over the last 50 years. Total CO2 emissions are often explained through the “Kaya identity” — how many people there are, their in- come, the energy efficiency of eco- nomies, and the carbon intensity of energy. We can use a similar fra- mework to understand the drivers of aviation emissions. This article looks at historical changes in aviation demand, effi- ciency, and its contribution to cli- mate change. Most of this work is based on an excellent paper by Candelaria Bergero and colleagues and another by David Lee and col- leagues. To calculate carbon emis- sions from aviation, we need to know three metrics. Aviation de- mand: how many passenger and freight kilometers; energy efficien- cy: how much energy is used per km; carbon intensity: what fuel is being used, which tells us the car- bon emitted per unit of energy. Multiply these metrics together, and we get CO2 emissions. At the same time, Rying has be- come more than twice as energy efficient. Travelling one passenger- km in 1990 used 2.9 megajoules The carbon intensity of that fuel — how much CO2 is emitted per unit — has not changed at all. We used standard jet fuel in 1990 and we are using the same today. It has not become any cleaner. Biofuels and other alternatives are just a ti- ny fraction of global demand. If Rying has become more than twice as energy efficient, and the carbon emitted per unit of energy has not changed, then it follows that the carbon efficiency of travel- ing one km is also more than twice as high. In 1990, one passenger-km 157 grams. How have the changes in demand and technology affect- ed CO2 emissions? Aviation’s share in global emis- sions has been calculated using the time series above and total CO2 emissions data using the Global Carbon Project. In 2019, aviation accounted for 2.5% of CO2 emis- sions from fossil sources and land use. This share Ructuated from 2%	 to 2.5% since the mid-1990s but with a marked increase since 2010 (Chart 3)."

"A HUNDRED YEARS AGO APRIL 16, 1924 Lake levels of Victoria Nyanza In a geographical memoir by O.E.P. Brooks, the author has set forth that the variations in the lake levels of Victoria Nyanza from 1896 to 1922 and those of Albert Nyanza from 1904 to 1922 as recorded by tide gauges, have occurred more in accordance with variations in sunspots than with those of rainfall. As most of the rain is removed by evaporation and as evaporation is highest during the periods of minimum sunspots, the lake levels are then lowest. He points out the level was highest in 1917, a year of maximum sunspots and there was no increase of rainfall to account for the high level. 8	Tuesday, April 16, 2024 News Chennai Indian officials can ‘soon’ meet crew: Iran Modi lauds poll bond scheme, says scrapping it is a mistake ‘PM was mastermind of the world’s biggest extortion scheme’ The Hindu Bureau NEW DELHI"

However, his Home Minister has found the time to campaign in the State today, and we hope he takes the initiative to answer a few questions on behalf of the PM.” For over 25 years, the two national parties have been dominating the politi- cal landscape on these is- lands, which have a lone Lok Sabha constituency.

"cenes of pure jubilation erupted at the BayArena on Sunday as Bayer Leverkusen emphatically secured its first-ever Bundesliga title. A dominant 5-0 victory against Werder Bremen sealed the historic feat with five games to spare. This remarkable triumph dethroned the mighty Bayern Munich, which held a vice-like grip on the league for eleven consecutive seasons. This fairytale ending comes just over a year after the club found itself precariously perched at the bottom of the table. But under the astute guidance of Xabi Alonso, who is in his first full season managing a club’s first team, Leverkusen has undergone a staggering metamorphosis, transforming from relegation candidates into invincible champions. The treble, with the Europa League and DFB Pokal trophies still within reach, beckons as a testament to this extraordinary journey."
"A style rooted in balance “We want to play modern football. That means: intensity with and without the ball, being more active than passive and with a strong mentality,” Alonso told Diario AS about his approach. Playing 3-4-2-1, Alonso’s Leverkusen is a well-drilled modern football team that likes to dominate possession and use counter-pressing to win the ball back when out of possession. Despite being an inexperienced coach at the top level, the Spaniard has played under some of the most inRuential managers of the modern era during his storied playing career.

It won the Bundesliga, booked itself a place in the final of DFB-Pokal and qualified for the quarterfinal in the Europa League while remaining the only unbeaten team in Europe’s top five leagues.

"studies suggested a genetic basis was improbable. Nevertheless, everything in biology has a genetic foundation. As a geneticist and molecular neuroscientist, I have devoted my career to predicting and preventing Parkinson’s disease. In our newly published research, my team and I discovered a new genetic variant linked to Parkinson’s that sheds light on the evolutionary origin of multiple forms of familial parkinsonism, opening doors to better understand and treat the disease."
"Genetic linkages and associations In the mid-1990s, researchers started looking into whether genetic differences between people with or without Parkinson’s might identify specific genes or genetic variants that cause the disease. In general, I and other geneticists use two approaches to map the genetic blueprint of Parkinson’s: linkage analysis and association studies. Linkage analysis focuses on rare families where parkinsonism, or neurological conditions with similar symptoms to Parkinson’s, is passed down. This technique looks for cases where a disease-causing version of the gene and Parkinson’s appear to be passed down in the same person. It requires information on your family tree, clinical data and DNA samples. Relatively few families, such as those with more than two living, affected relatives willing to participate, are needed to expedite new genetic discoveries. “Linkage” between a pathogenic genetic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform a diagnosis. It has also become the basis of many lab models used to study the consequences of gene dysfunction and how to fix it. Linkage studies, like the one my team and I published, have identified pathogenic mutations in over 20 genes. Notably, many patients in families with parkinsonism have symptoms that are indistinguishable from typical, late-onset Parkinson’s. Nevertheless, what causes inherited"
"THE SCIENCE QUIZ Parkinsonism, which typically affects people with earlier-onset disease, may not be the cause of Parkinson’s in the general population. Conversely, genome-wide association studies, or GWAS, compare genetic data from patients with Parkinson’s with unrelated people of the same age, gender and ethnicity who don’t have the disease. Typically, this involves assessing how frequently in both groups over 2 million common gene variants appear. Because these studies require analysing so many gene variants, researchers need to gather clinical data and DNA samples from over 100,000 people. Although costly and time-consuming, the findings of genome-wide association studies are widely applicable. Combining the data of these studies has identified many locations in the genome that contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson’s. Currently, there are over 92 locations in the genome that contain about 350 genes potentially involved in the disease. However, GWAS locations can be considered only in aggregate; individual results are not helpful in diagnosis nor in disease modeling, as the contribution of these individual genes to disease risk is so minimal. Together, “linked” and “associated” discoveries imply a number of molecular pathways are involved in Parkinson’s. Each identified gene and the proteins they encode typically can have more than one effect. The functions of each gene and protein may also vary by cell type. The question is which gene variants, functions and pathways are most relevant to Parkinson’s? How do researchers meaningfully connect this data? Parkinson’s disease genes Linkage between a pathogenic variant and disease development is so significant that it can inform diagnosis. It has also become the basis of many lab models used to study the consequences of gene dysfunction"
"Poland, Turkey, Tunisia, the U.S. and the U.K. Although the affected individuals and families originate from many parts of the world, they share an identical fragment of chromosome 6 that contains RAB32 Ser71Arg. This suggests these patients are all related to the same person; ancestrally, they are distant cousins. It also suggests there are many more cousins to identify. With further analysis, we found RAB32 Ser71Arg interacts with several proteins previously linked to early- and late-onset Parkinsonism as well as nonfamilial Parkinson’s disease. The RAB32 Ser71Arg variant also causes similar dysfunction within cells. Together, the proteins encoded by these linked genes optimize levels of the Such linked genes support the idea that these causes of inherited parkinsonism evolved to improve survival in early life because they enhance immune response to pathogens. RAB32 Ser71Arg suggest how and why many mutations have originated, despite creating a susceptible genetic background for Parkinson’s in later life. RAB32 Ser71Arg is the first linked gene researchers have identified that directly connects the dots between prior linked discoveries. The proteins encoded bring together three important functions of the cell: autophagy, immunity and mitochondrial function. While autophagy releases energy stored in the cell’s trash, this needs to be coordinated with another specialized component within the cell, mitochondria, that are the major supplier of energy. Mitochondria also help to control cell immunity because"
"Identifying subtle genetic di erences Finding the molecular blueprint for familial Parkinson’s is the first step to fixing the faulty mechanisms behind the disease. Like the owner’s manual to your car’s engine, it provides a practical guide of what to check when the motor fails. Just as each make of motor is subtly different, what makes each person genetically susceptible to nonfamilial Parkinson’s disease is also subtly different. However, analyzing genetic data can now test for types of dysfunction in the cell that are hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease. This will help researchers identify environmental factors that inRuence the risk of developing Parkinson’s, as well as medications that may help protect against the disease. As our discovery illustrates, each new gene that researchers identify can profoundly improve our ability to predict and prevent Parkinson’s.

"Mountaineering expeditions led by Col. airfields, from where Mi-8, Mi-17, Cheetah and Chetak helicopters ferried men and material to the icy heights on the glacier, far above the limits helicopters were CM meant to be operated. Soon, about 300-odd troops were positioned on the strategically important peaks and passes of the glacier, the IAF recounted in a statement on Operation Meghdoot. From 1984 to 2003, both sides were exchanging fire regularly. The guns finally fell silent in 2003 after the ceasefire agreement along the LoC and the 110km long Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) in Siachen. While the LoC has Rared up on multiple occasions, ceasefire along the AGPL has held since. Operation Meghdoot continues to this day, becoming the longest continuing operation in the world."
"A test of endurance The actual Army posts are located at heights of 18,000 feet and above, with the Bana post being the highest on the glacier and Indira Col the highest point. At 18,000-19,000 feet, Indian and Pakistani posts face each other; however, at 20,000 feet and beyond, it is only India."
"The glacier is also bearing the brunt of climate change. Elaborating on major enhancements in the last five years, officials say that mobile and data connectivity has improved considerably. “The introduction of VSAT technology has revolutionised communication on the glacier, providing troops with data and internet connectivity. This leap in technology has enhanced real-time situational awareness, telemedicine capabilities, and the well-being of our soldiers by keeping them connected with their families,” one official said. Today, nearly all the aircraft of the IAF including Rafale, Su-30MKI, Chinook, C-130 J, IL-76 and An-32 operate in support of Operation Meghdoot, the IAF said. Helicopters continue to remain the lifeline on the glacier supporting troops in remote posts. IAF’s 114 helicopter unit along with the Army aviation continues to play a stellar role."

"out of the borehole and punch small holes into the casing. More often than not, the pressure inside the well is sufficiently lower than in the surrounding rock for the hydrocarbons to start Rowing into the well and rise up on their own. And as they rise, they are forced to exit at the top via a narrower tube — which is installed to, among other things, encourage the Ruids to Row in only one direction (out). The Row of hydrocarbons ends the completion stage and begins the production stage, when the most important aspects of the extraction ver millennia, mighty geological processes in the earth’s crust heated and compressed together pieces of"
"Where are hydrocarbons located? The most common forms in which these hydrocarbons exist in subterranean rock formations are natural gas, coal, crude oil, and petroleum. They are usually found in underground reservoirs created when a more resistant rock type overlays a less resistant one, in effect creating a lid that causes hydrocarbons to accumulate below it. Such formations are important because otherwise, the hydrocarbons would Roat to the surface and dissipate. Experts use the tools, methods, and techniques of the field of petroleum geology to assess these rocks, including to check for their porosity and permeability. If a rock formation is highly porous, it could hold a larger quantity of hydrocarbons. Similarly, the more permeable a rock is, more easily the hydrocarbons will Row through it. The primary source of hydrocarbons in this rocky underground is called kerogen: lumps of organic matter. Kerogen can be deposited from three possible sources: as the remains of a lake (lacustrine), of a larger marine ecosystem, or of a terrestrial ecosystem. Rocks surrounding the kerogen can become warmer, more compact over time, exerting forces on the kerogen that cause it to break down. Lacustrine kerogen yields waxy oils; marine kerogen, oil and gas; and terrestrial kerogen, light oils, gas, and coal. The rock containing the kerogen is called the source rock, and petroleum geologists are tasked with looking for it, understanding its geophysical and thermal characteristics, and characterising its ability to yield hydrocarbons. They also undertake modelling activities informed by observational data and dig smaller exploration wells to estimate the amount of hydrocarbons there, and report it to the relevant regulatory body. Once a particular location is determined to be a profitable source of hydrocarbons, drilling can begin."
"How are the hydrocarbons accessed? Drilling and reservoir engineers are responsible for extracting as much of the hydrocarbons as is gainful without damaging the reservoir, to which end they deploy a variety of methods. The first task is to create a production well, the principal hole through which the reservoir will be drained to the surface; its location is chosen to maximise the amount of drainage. The well is created with a drilling machine. The drill consists of the drill pipe, the drill collars towards the bottom, and the drill bit at the bottom. The drill bit is the object that THE DAILY QUIZ The outline of an oil pump. ISTOCKPHOTO"
"breaks through the rock, creating a hole as it tunnels further down. Once the tunnelling is underway, engineers lower steel casings that are slightly less wide than the hole itself into the tunnel, and pump cement slurry in the gap between the outer edge of the tunnel and the casings. As the cement solidifies, it protects the upper parts of the tunnel from caving in and prevents Ruids in the surrounding soil from entering the well. The tunnel is also filled with drilling Ruid, which reaches and swirls around the drill bit. Its primary purposes are to keep the bit from overheating and to bring the pieces of rock being cut away with it when it is pumped to the surface, where they can be removed from the tunnel. The pressure at which the drilling Ruid is delivered needs to be carefully controlled or it could force the hydrocarbons in the source rock to rush into the gap between the casing and the drill string (pipe + collar + bit) and erupt on the surface like a volcano of oil. The process of recording the rock cuttings by depth and studying their properties is called mud-logging. As the drill bit descends, the length of the drill pipe is increased by tacking on extensions; it can also be pulled up if it needs replacing."
"How are the hydrocarbons extracted? Once the production well has been drilled, it has to be prepared to drain the hydrocarbons — a step called completing. Here, engineers remove the drill string operation are the systems at the well’s The production profile of a well can be split into three phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary, depending on the methods required to maintain production. The primary phase banks on natural processes, like pressure differences between the reservoir and the well and less dense compounds Roating to the top. Secondary interventions are concerned with inducing artificial pressure in the rock to maintain the differential (for example, by injecting water into it or diluting the hydrocarbon mix to help it Row better). The tertiary phase is focused on forcing the remainder into the well. Steam injection is a common example of such an enhanced recovery method. An on-site gas turbine generates electricity while its waste heat is routed to a steam generator. The resulting steam is pumped into the rock: its heat makes heavy-oil hydrocarbons less viscous and more willing to Row while its pressure pushes them out. When recovering petroleum, for example, the well may yield about 15%, 45%, and 15% of its hydrocarbon volume in three respective phases."
"What happens when a well is depleted? As the extraction rates indicate, a well needn’t be fully depleted before the extraction process ends. The process’s economics matter greatly: the contractor may stop extraction if it’s no longer profitable to keep extracting from a well. The most exhaustive way to conclude operations at a well, whether on land or offshore, is to decommission it, but this process is expensive and often commercially infeasible for the proponent. Improperly abandoned wells are a major source of methane emissions — to go with the emissions released during the production and use of various components required to extract hydrocarbons. One 2018 study estimated that 9,000 oilfields in 90 countries released 1.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2015 alone.

"Introduction of trawling The use of bottom trawlers did incalculable harm to the sea bed. The trawlers swept away everything from the sea bed, resulting in no fish being available on the Indian side of the Palk Bay. Indian fishermen have to enter Sri Lankan waters to fish. And Sri Lankan fishermen began to complain that Indian trawlers would also destroy their sea bed. What is more, bottom trawlers are banned in Sri Lanka. The need to have good personal relations with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mrs. Bandaranaike was the main reason guiding India’s Sri Lanka policy. By early 1974, Mrs. Gandhi was determined to cede the island. According to S.P. Jagota, then Director of the Legal and Treaties Division, Mrs Gandhi overruled the views of senior officials. What is more, she was even prepared to modify the median line so that Katchatheevu would fall on the Sri Lankan side. The Agreement, however, provided for the continued use of Sri Lankan waters around the island for the purposes of fishing, but this right was also given up under the 1976 Agreement. M. Karunanidhi’s attitude, to say the least, was strange. Before the signing of the Agreement, B.C. Roy submitted evidence that Beru Bari was an integral part of India and to give away Indian territory to a foreign country, the Constitution would have to be amended. The Court upheld the claim. Two interrelated points must be highlighted."
"The need for bold decisions Every challenge provides an opportunity. The problems in the Palk Bay can be solved only if we start thinking outside the box. Here are two suggestions. The Palk Bay is not a barrier but a bridge between India and Sri Lanka. We must convert the Palk Bay from being a contested territory to one that is a common heritage. The first essential prerequisite is for the Government of India to ban all fishing equipment which are banned in Sri Lanka. And then, we should work to ensure that fishermen can equitably enjoy the rich marine wealth. There can be a formula: Sri Lankan fishermen can fish in the Palk Bay for three days, while Indian fishermen can fish on the other three days. One day can be a holiday. Second, let us encourage the Tamil fishermen of both countries to meet, form cooperative societies, and venture into deep-sea fishing. The trawlers can be modified into vessels that can assist the mother ship. Such joint ventures will also help repair the	 	 damage Indian fishermen have caused to the livelihood of their Tamil counterparts.

We have compared the res- ponses in a pre-poll survey done in 2019 and the re- sults from the current stu- dy. A higher percentage would say we are now able to fulfil our needs and save. A much lower per- centage would say that we find difficulty in fulfilling our needs and find it diffi- cult to save money. On this parameter, there is a visi- ble class divide. Half the poor respondents said that we face difficulties in fulfill- ing our needs.

"The farmers’ protests have become a critical point of contention, spark- ing diverse opinions across the nation. The heated de- bate over the legitimacy of their demands versus alle- gations of a calculated pol- itical ploy has led to polar- ised viewpoints. The pre-poll survey indicates a skew in favour of the agitat- ing farmers’ right to prot- est. Nearly three in five (59%) respondents ack- nowledge the legitimacy of the farmers’ demands and recognise it as the funda- mental right of farmers to voice their grievances. On the other hand, nearly one in six (16%) vo- ters perceive the farmers’ protest as a conspiracy against the government. This viewpoint suggests scepticism regarding the motivations behind the protests, with some attri- buting them to political agendas rather than ge- nuine concerns for the agricultural community, doubting the protesters’ in- tentions and objectives. The survey also reveals that one in 10 respondents (11%) either lack awareness of the protests or are unfa- miliar with the farmers’ de- mands. This lack of awareness is marginally higher (12%) among farmers’ house- holds. This is not surpris- ing since the protests have been centred mostly in north-west India. However, the majority support the farmers’ prot- ests; support for this is comparatively	higher among farmers, with close to two in three (63%) indi- viduals from farm house- holds expressing solidarity with the protests, possibly connecting to their own ex- perience of challenges in the agricultural sector. Yet, one in 10 (11%) farmers align with the belief that the protests are a well- planned conspiracy, high- lighting internal divisions within the farming com- munity regarding the legiti- macy of the movement.

"The DMK is the only party that never waited for the Supreme Court order to come out and said this is who our donors are. But if you  see  the  BJP,  it  got ₹8,500 crore (numbers are yet to be finalised); a com- pany which has got ₹1 lakh turnover is giving [the BJP] ₹100 crore, and a company which is closed down, is giving ₹100 crore. The names of companies are so weird. That means there are bigger companies be- hind. They’re using some other company names to give. Those who are getting raided are giving the mo- ney. So, it is very, very clear you are misusing the official machinery like the ED, the CBI to benefit. So the INDIA bloc’s campaign in the rest of the country has been more on the secularism plank. So what percentage of your campaign is on secularism?"

"“I suggested she move to Kerala. I belong to a middle class background myself and so I know how valuable finances are to this decision,” George recollected. He credits the Women’s Premier League for helping Arundhati to muster up strength and cut the umbilical cord. “WPL gave her the security to move away from Railways. There’s some money there so she won’t starve. WPL gives these players a platform to be noticed and she then has this state team option (Kerala) that is making knockouts in the ecosystem.

From having bowled just nine overs last season and taking two wickets, she bowled 29.5 in 2024 and finished with eight scalps. Under the DC canopy, Arundhati worked on her wrist position at the point of release to manage quicker speeds and more seam variations. Batting drills involved power hitting sessions too. She was also a gun fielder and a reliable operator in any field position. For George, the change wasn’t as much about statistics and stratagem as it was about having a safe space to bloom. “Aru coming to Kerala has been a blessing both ways. The way the youngsters look up to her… There is a young talent in Kerala - Joshitha V J. She is a real quick bowler. She speaks to me constantly about ‘Aru di, Aru told me this, Aru di told me that.’ Arundhati is not someone who is super rich but she would spend money on these kids… to get them good equipment, sometimes for coaching. She does this even for girls who aren’t in the senior side. A player I won’t name was going for coaching at this particular place and she wasn’t someone with the kind of resources to do that and I got to know Aru is the one who is giving her the money to go there and get her stuff done.

But kind hearts need to be set aside on a cricket pitch. a nascent relationship and Arjun, who also coaches Shreyanka Patil, is not looking to tweak drastically. If there is one thing he is doing, it’s pushing her to take risks. “One thing I have worked on is her efficacy on bowling to the leg side,” he told The Hindu. “Leg side fields, five fielders standing along positions on this half are not conventional and could even be scoffed at. I am okay if she gets hit for runs, but we’ve worked on trying to get more wickets with bowling on this side of the stumps.” Arundhati is a formidable force with the bat, but the positions she gets in international and franchise cricket is down the order.

"he popular understanding seems to be that the day is not far off when artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to think like humans and interact, at least through languages, in a way that is indistinguishable from real humans. Such a day has been called “the singularity,” a pivotal moment for the human race. With the recent success of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which are capable of interpreting language use and composing sentences, many think this day is imminent. When confronted with such a possibility, Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the most inRuential philosophers of the 20th century, famously said, “But a machine surely cannot think!” He perhaps meant the concepts of thinking and intelligence can only apply to living objects; it would be grammatically and logically incorrect otherwise. Nevertheless, machines can indeed share some traits of human behaviour, so even without precise definitions of these terms, their increasing use for machines is perhaps germane. In fact, in the eventuality that we do go past the “singularity”— a proposition that sounds frightening — a machine may have to be treated someday like a person. The universal computer Most people trained in computer science believe such AI must be possible. This is because central to the accepted theory of computation, as obtained among others by Alan Turing in 1936, is the existence of the abstract algorithmic concept of a The ultimate test of AI will have to be based on explanatory theories of AI. And if we understand them, we should be able to programme them. CASH MACANAYA/UNSPLASH exist computational problems that can’t be solved by a universal computer, as established by Gödel’s incompleteness whose solutions will require ever increasing amounts of time and memory resources. We clearly do not have the right theory of intelligence as yet."
"A stone, a watch, a frog Further, scientific theories are not derived from observations in nature. They are obtained through a process of abduction, by making hypotheses — sometimes with wild guesses — and critiquing and reasoning about them, often with physical experiments, but again not always. Indeed, we have obtained fantastic theories like quantum mechanics and gravitation based on curved spacetime only using such methods. They were only validated post-facto with observations from experiments and telescopes. It is like a philosopher trying to tell a living object by just looking at a stone, a watch, and a frog. The test also does not reveal who is responsible for the AI’s behaviour. If it was an external designer, the programme is not an AI. Since last June, the world has broken heat records each month.

"The world experienced the warmest March ever due to a combined effect of El Niño and human-caused climate change, making it the 10th consecutive month since June last year to set a new temperature record, the European Union’s climate agency said on April 9. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said the average temperature of 14.14 degrees C in March was 1.68 degrees C higher than the month’s average for 1850–1900, the designated pre-industrial reference period. It is 0.10 degrees C above the previous high of March 2016. C3S said the global average temperature breached the 1.5 degrees C threshold for an entire year for the first time in January."

If it is, it will also need sensorimotor perception because it cannot possibly rely on external intelligence to provide it with the essential methods to survive and exchange signals with the outside world. Turing also estimated that the resources required to simulate a human brain, which he argued must also be a universal computer, will not be very large — in fact, less than that of a typical modern laptop. After all, the average size of the human brain is not all that much. And the fact that there must"
"THE SCIENCE QUIZ theorem and Turing’s own results on computability, did not deter his arguments because humans also can’t solve many problems. He also formulated a test for AI where a human judge should be unable to tell whether it is a human or a programme based on interacting with it. Many believe that current state-of-the-art LLM-based AI software like ChatGPT, built using deep neural networks, may have come close to passing this Turing test."
"The  right  theory  of  intelligence Thus, the question arises: do we know how the brain works to be able to programme a universal simulator for AI? That is, can a parametrised neural network model with parameters estimated using a purely data-driven inductive method become a programme for the universal simulator? Unfortunately, the answers to these have to be a resounding ‘no’. We are not even close. Indeed, as the example below demonstrates, ChatGPT does not seem to understand even the basic logic of numbers, despite its copious training from examples.

"The determinants of unemployment Figure 2 depicts the relationship between unemployment rates and the share of the labour force in self-employment. The trend line drawn through the data is downward-sloping, indicating that there exists a negative relationship between the two; in States where a large proportion of the labour force is engaged in self-employment, the unemployment rate is low. Since a bulk of the self-employment in India is of the informal variety, States with a large proportion of informal work would find it easy to absorb a large number of job-seekers. Yet it is unclear whether this relationship is cause or effect. Does a lack of self-employment opportunities result in high unemployment? Or is it that in States with high unemployment, individuals do not wish to engage in self-employment? A large proportion of informal self-employment is accounted for by agriculture and the rural economy. A useful proxy, therefore, is to examine the size of the labour force engaged in the Urbanised States have smaller agrarian and agrarian-dependent sectors and hence have a relatively smaller source of informal jobs available. While informal sectors do exist — and thrive — in urban settings, the scope for the absorption of job-seekers is limited as compared to rural agriculture, which often acts as a ‘reserve’ absorbing surplus labour. always faced unemployment, even when the modern sector was in its infancy.

"uring the inter-zonal one-day tournament early this year, there was a day when South Zone captain Shreyanka Patil was having a poor day at the office. Her West counterpart, Smriti Mandhana, went up to her to console her and she broke down. “I can be myself around Smriti,” Shreyanka remembered. “I wasn’t happy with my bowling. She reassured me and said, ‘it’s okay. March 17th, you’re going to do it for us.’” True to word, Shreyanka would pick four wickets giving away a miserly 12 runs in 3.3 overs to help Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Delhi Capitals to lift its maiden Women’s Premier League title. Cricket is a game filled with characters of every variety. You have the quiet geniuses on one end who believe their sport and skill can do the talking for them. Then there’s this other bunch – loud, proud, happy to show their swagger on the field as much as they do off it. Shreyanka belongs to this second kind. After Richa Ghosh hit the winning runs, Shreyanka – along with a number of her teammates – was unstoppable. She was dancing constantly, coordinating group steps for the side; jumping on people, hugging people. It’s like no one was watching, no inhibitions, no limits. As the team posed by the champions’ photo op area, Shreyanka stood before it, dancing away to glory, like a little ballerina too immersed in her performance to have a thought for the world. “I just wanted to be myself. I told Smriti, please don’t stop me today. I just want to be myself. And she was like all yours,” she said. This was a marked difference to how her season began. The 21-year-old got off to an underwhelming start in WPL season two. In her first match (against UP Warriorz), she conceded 32 runs without a wicket in three overs. Against Gujarat Giants, she conceded 13 runs in a single over bowled. Against an imposing Delhi Capitals, she gave away 40 runs in three overs, getting a wicket too while she gave away 15 runs in two overs for a wicket against Mumbai Indians. “Shreyanka was the first one to come up and say, ‘I am not bowling well.’ She didn’t need me or anyone else to go to her with that... She came and asked, ‘I am not bowling well. What can I do?” She’ll come up with the solutions too. That’s her character,” Malolan Rangarajan, RCB’s assistant coach revealed after the Eliminator where the side beat Mumbai Indians for the second time. ▼ Shreyanka finished with the Purple Cap in the second edition of the Women's Premier League with 13 wickets in eight matches ▼ During a league fixture against Mumbai Indians, she sustained a hairline fracture in her left hand while trying to save a six.

"Regaining her mojo Incidentally, in the final, Shreyanka dismissed Lanning once more, a wicket that turned the face of the game. Shreyanka came into that game having missed two matches due to an injury to her hand. The break was a blessing in disguise not just in helping her get some time off but also in working on what was going wrong with her technique, if anything. Stir crazy Shreyanka did not enjoy life on the sidelines. Dev believes that it isn’t so much the person she dismissed as it was about her own sense of her technique that turned Shreyanka’s season for her. “When the small things go your way, it feels good. We focus on how it’s coming out of the hands,” Dev explained. “If she’s giving it enough revs, if she’s actually over-spinning the ball — these are small technical things that we focus on. She knows these things, how to look for them and correct them. She understands her bowling enough to do most of it herself. It doesn’t even have to mean CM"
"While Lanning’s wicket in the game was the first of four she would go on to take in that crunch league game, she was left in tears as RCB fell short by one solitary run, with teammates and opponents alike rushing to console her for a remarkable fight, irrespective of the result. In the Eliminator, much like the league game before that against the same opponent — Mumbai Indians, Shreyanka was fielded in the death, partnering Sophie Molineux and Asha Sobhana in keeping things tight and eventually helping RCB make the summit clash. She also took the key wickets of Hayley Matthews and Harmanpreet Kaur when RCB was defending a subpar 135 against an imposing MI batting lineup. “When you see things like that, you know that when there are crunch moments, these characters will stand up and deliver. Shreyanka is a warrior. Playing with a niggle, nobody will think she has an injury. These are characters we are very proud to have in RCB and we’re excited to see what she will go on to do for the club and the country,” Rangarajan said after the game. Shreyanka foxing Harmanpreet was no Ruke. She was happy to risk the MI captain switching into her trigger-happy mode if it meant she could draw out an error."
Character  development   in   CPL The significance of this Harmanpreet wicket and how it came about reminds Dev of how the duo plotted Matthews’ wicket when Shreyanka turned out for the Guyana Amazon Warriors in the Caribbean Premier League last year. She beat Matthews with a quicker ball which went too full and clipped her off stump. It
"That tournament was transformative for Shreyanka in more ways than one. “CPL was a great experience for her in terms of growing up… just being the overseas player and having the responsibility helped her grow up a little bit. She’s always been looked after like a baby so this helped in maturing a bit in terms of the way she thinks about the game,” Dev said. He credits Stafanie Taylor, Shreyanka’s captain at the franchise, for much of it. “In domestic cricket, I don’t think R.V. MOORTHY"
"Ripple e ect Dev points out how rubbing shoulders with the likes of Perry could go a long way in rounding out Shreyanka as an individual in a cut-throat sport like cricket. “There was a moment in the Eliminator where Perry dove by the boundary trying to stop a ball. She couldn’t and it went for four. She could have, per her own lofty standards. Anyone else would have hit the ground or said, ‘damn’ but not Perry. She picked up the ball and ran to her next fielding position. Those things go a long way. Your body language is picked up by these kids. Hopefully that passes on from Shreyanka to the domestic cricket circles she moves around in,” he said. S CH-CHE II	Tuesday, March 19, 2024"
"SCIENCE Geologists can’t agree when the Anthropocene began, but it did A closer examination of the archaeological and historical antecedents of human impacts reveals that while humans have left an indelible mark on the natural environment over the ages, they reached a state of heightened activity only since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution Chennai C. P. Rajendran"
"cientists recently proposed formalising an ‘Anthropocene Epoch’ on the geologic time scale, triggering several debates. The earth’s geological history is divided into multiple epochs depending on their natural character. We are officially currently in the Holocene Epoch, which started around 11,700 years ago. But many scientists believe the Holocene Epoch has ended and the Anthropocene Epoch has started – a period of time characterised by humankind’s large-scale effects on the earth, including climate change and pollution. The proposal – to make the Anthropocene Epoch official – came from the Anthropocene Working Group of the Sub-commission of Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS-AWG). In the proposal, the group has said the start date of the Epoch can be linked to the formation of a particular layer of the ground. As the earth’s surface evolves, new layers of rock, soil, and other materials are deposited on old ones. Each layer, or stratum, is thus a marker of a previous era. The SQS-AWG is a commission responsible for recognising time units within our most recent period of geologic time. Its members have been looking into the question of formalising the Anthropocene Epoch as the youngest Plastic chemicals more than estimated: report Reuters At least 3,000 more chemicals are in plastics — from food packaging to toys to medical devices — than previously estimated by environmental agencies, a report published on Thursday found, raising questions over pollution and consumer safety."
"How long has the Epoch been under study? co-authored an article with marine biologist Eugene Stoermer in a newsletter. Here, he defined a putative geological epoch to mark the start of human’s transformation of the planet. Later, thanks to an article in Nature in 2002, Dr. Crutzen was able to garner wider acceptance for his neologism. He also suggested the onset of the Anthropocene Epoch coincide with the Industrial Revolution from the late 18th century. There are conceptual antecedents of the term ‘Anthropocene’ in older literature. In Man and Nature (1864), the American polymath George Pekins Marsh presented perhaps the first major, and prescient, discussion of the anthropogenic changes wrought by human activities. The Italian geologist and priest Antonio Stoppani, in a book published between 1865 and 1870, referred to an “Anthropozoic” era in stratigraphic terms. THE SCIENCE QUIZ"
"The proposal also risked sowing confusion about the deep history of how humans are transforming the planet. The human impact was evident when the sabre-toothed cats began to disappear from North America and the woolly mammoths from Siberia about 10,000 years ago. Human activities also became more visible in the ‘fertile crescent’ of West Asia midway through the Holocene Epoch, about 6,000 years ago, with the rise of agriculture and deforestation to make way for farmland. Since then, humans have developed many technologies capable of manipulating the environment, including mechanisation, irrigation, groundwater extraction, damming, and the industrial production of nitrogen-rich fertilisers. Even around 1850, the concentrations of two major greenhouse gases, carbon As the earth’s surface evolves, new layers of rock, soil, and other materials are deposited on old ones. Each layer, or stratum, is thus a marker of a previous era dioxide and methane, were rising at an accelerated rate. These compounds can modify the environment such that it becomes unfriendly to many forms of life."
"Significance of post-Industrial era? However, a closer examination of the archaeological and historical antecedents of human impacts reveals that while humans left an indelible mark on the natural environment over the ages, they reached a state of heightened activity only since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. For example, consider four important markers of the Anthropocene Epoch. The first is temperature – specifically, the predicted increase in the global average surface temperature, at least by 1.1 degrees but possibly by as much as 6.4 degrees C by the end of this century (which would be an all-time high since the last thermal maximum 40 million years ago). Second, the quickening extinction of various species at a scale similar in magnitude to a major extinction event that occurred 80 million years ago. Third, a dramatic increase in the erosion and the denudation of continents, at a pace an order of magnitude greater than what one would expect from purely natural processes. Finally, both accelerating urbanisation, land-use changes, and pro-urban migration have been accompanied by perennial water depletion and shortage. Over the last century or so, many major rivers that have been dammed and diverted have lost their water-carrying capacity. In fact, the argument that the rejection of the Anthropocene Epoch proposal is because of the fairly recent date of commencement and its shallow depth misses the larger picture. When Dr."

"Measuring di erences The authors measured the differences in the survival rate between dialysis centres across India and evaluated the extent to which these differences are explained by centre-based characteristics. They found that centre- and patient- level characteristics are associated with survival, but there remains an unexplained variation between centres. In this study, one of the largest of its nature, over 23,600 patients, undergoing haemodialysis at any centre in the NephroPlus network, for 90 days or more, between April 2014 and June 2019 were chosen. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, measured from 90 days after joining a centre. The individual-level variables included sex, smoking status, history of diabetes, history of heart disease or heart failure, history of hypertension, hepatitis B and hepatitis C in patients. Besides this, other categories such as education, monthly household income, dialysis frequency and vascular access were factored in for evaluation. The centre-level variables included frequency of nephrologist visits, number of beds, number of staff and number of patients."
"Mortality rate After accounting for multi-level factors, the estimated 180-day survival ranged between 83% and 97%. The mortality rate in patients attending rural centres was 32% higher than those at urban centres. This latter figure was likely due in part to unmeasured differences in patient characteristics. Nevertheless, it highlights the unique challenges faced by rural centres, the authors aver. Among the patient characteristics associated with mortality were: There was an inverse relationship between mortality and dialysis vintage, with those receiving dialysis for at least a year prior to joining a centre having a 17% lower rate of mortality than those who started dialysis less than 30 days before joining. The presence of diabetes was associated with a higher mortality rate. By including centre-level factors in the analysis; for instance, staffing, processes of care and patient volume, they found it reduced the variability in survival across dialysis centres by 31%."
"The way forward The authors propose this as the first national benchmark for survival amongst dialysis patients in India. As India continues to widen dialysis access, ongoing quality improvement programs will be an important part of ensuring that patients experience the best-possible outcomes at the point of care. In future, it is clear that the number of patients in need of dialysis will increase. While overall improvements in health infrastructure and care are essential to keep pace with the demand, the authors of the study underline the need for a collaborative quality improvement system across the country. Alongside establishing national standards for dialysis outcomes in India, it is important to understand the multilevel effects of centre- and Therefore, establishing national benchmarks for dialysis outcomes against which the dialysis centres’ performances and changes over time can be compared is essential to drive this, they say, arguing that their findings present the first step in this voyage."
